Summary: The paper introduces a task to edit personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs) by adjusting their responses to opinion-related questions. The technique is effective for long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence-length passkey context block retrieval, and 500K book summarizing tasks using 1B and 8B LLMs. The proposed solution uses minimally constrained memory parameters to enable fast streaming inference for LLMs. Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of complex reasoning and planning tasks, but struggle with complex scenarios.',\n",

TUPA is a general neural transition-based DAG parser, which we use\\nto present the first experiments on recovering enhanced dependencies as part of\\nthe general parsing task. TUPA was designed for parsing UCCA, a\\ncross-linguistic semantic annotation scheme, exhibiting reentrancy,\\ndiscontinuity and non-terminal nodes. By converting UD trees and graphs to a\\nUCCA-like DAG format, we train TUPA almost without modification on the UD\\nparsing task. The generic nature of our approach lends itself naturally to\\nmultitask learning. Our code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/CoNLL-UD-2018/HUJI\\n\\nPublished: 2018-05-01\\nTitle: Multitask Parsing Across Semantic Representations\\nAuthors: Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend, Ari Rappoport\\nSummary: The ability to consolidate information of different types is at the core of\\nintelligence, and has tremendous practical value in allowing learning for one\\ntask to benefit from generalizations learned for others. In this paper we\\ntackle the challenging task of improving semantic parsing performance, taking\\nUCCA parsing as a test case, and AMR, SDP and Universal Dependencies (UD)\\nparsing as auxiliary tasks. We experiment on three languages, using a uniform\\ntransition-based system and learning architecture for all parsing tasks.\\nDespite notable conceptual, formal and domain differences, we show that\\nmultitask learning significantly improves UCCA parsing in both in-domain and\\nout-of-domain settings.\\n\\nPublished: 2017-04-04\\nTitle: A Transition-Based Directed Acyclic Graph Parser for UCCA\\nAuthors: Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend, Ari Rappoport\\nSummary: We present the first parser for UCCA, a cross-linguistically applicable\\nframework for semantic representation, which builds on extensive typological\\nwork and supports rapid annotation. UCCA poses a challenge for existing parsing\\ntechniques, as it exhibits reentrancy (resulting in DAG structures),\\ndiscontinuous structures and non-terminal nodes corresponding to complex\\nsemantic units. To our knowledge, the conjunction of these formal properties is\\nnot supported by any existing parser. Our transition-based parser, which uses a\\nnovel transition set and features based on bidirectional LSTMs, has value not\\njust for UCCA parsing: its ability to handle more general graph structures can\\ninform the development of parsers for other semantic DAG structures, and in\\nlanguages that frequently use discontinuous structures.'"

Local feature matching methods are only able to identify the correspondent's location when it is visible, while humans can also hallucinate its location when it is occluded or outside the field of view through geometric reasoning.  In this paper, we bridge this gap by training a network to output a peaked probability distribution over the correspondent's location, regardless of this correspondent being visible, occluded, or outside the field of view.  We experimentally demonstrate that this network is indeed able to hallucinate correspondences on pairs of images captured in scenes that were not seen at training-time.  We also apply this network to an absolute camera pose estimation problem and find it is significantly more robust than state-of-the-art local feature matching-based competitors.\",\n",

Please highlight that NeurHal can output \\\"location\\\" of outpaint._ \\n   We added a paragraph discussing our approach versus [Germain 2021] in Sec. A.5 of the updated version of the paper.\\n2. _It is Ok to say it is not a baseline. From geometric perspective, an non-learning baseline could be: 1. compute a homography from the source image to the target image using 4-point-method and RANSAC. 2. mapping all keypoints from source image to target image. Some of the keypoints will be out of the boundary of the target image. This baseline has a couple of assumptions: low depth variance of the scene, sufficient number keypoint to perform the homography estimation. However, it is better than the uniform correspondence map._\\n   We added an experiment that uses homography estimates to warp source keypoints as you suggested in Sec. A.2 and Fig. 9 of the updated version of the paper.\\n3. _Figure 4 highlights the paper's contribution on inpainting and outpainting keypoints. Why not show the result for identified keypoints. In applications such as 3D reconstruction, the matching accuracy of identified keypoints are more important than non-identified keypoints which are excluded in the rest of the pipeline line._\\n   We agree that 3D reconstruction is a very important application, however performing 3D reconstruction from coarse correspondence maps is not straightforward. In the paper we focused on hallucinating correspondences using a low-resolution correspondence map setting, which prevents NeurHal from predicting highly accurate correspondences. Thus we left as future work the relevance of applying NeurHal to 3D reconstruction.\\n4. _It is clear to me now. 5 and 6: I checked the score table in the link. LoFTR, DRCNet, SP+SG, R2D2, S2D are indeed stat-of-the-art. However, still need to clarify 1. Do you perform the same task as in the https://www.visuallocalization.net/benchmark/? From the writing, the \\\"absolute-pose\\\" is actually the relative pose between the source image view and target image view._\\n   We would like to clarify we do follow the same task as the online benchmark: We perform absolute camera pose estimation (ie. we estimate the rotation matrix between the source and the target images as well as the full 3 D.o.F. translation vector between the optical centers of the source and target cameras). We call this task \\\"absolute camera pose estimation\\\" as the depth of the source image is known which allows us to estimate the full 3 D.o.F. vector. This is as opposed to the \\\"relative camera pose estimation\\\" problem where the depth is unknown, thus the scale of the translation is not observable and only the translation direction can be retrieved.\\n5. _In Figure 7, you choose a different threshold (1.5m and 20^o) from these in the score board ((0.25m, 2\\u00b0) / (0.5m, 5\\u00b0) / (5m, 10\\u00b0)). The angular error threshold is much bigger than the standard (~5^o). Why?_\\n   We would like to highlight that the choice of our thresholds are arbitrary, in fact the choice of thresholds in visual localization benchmarks is rarely backed by statistical evidence. In order to show that our thresholds are not too loose, we reported in Figure 13 the performance of NeurHal, state-of-the-art feature matching methods and the identity pose, on ScanNet for several rotation and translation thresholds. We can see that 1.5m / 20.0\\u00b0 is not an \\\"easy\\\" threshold because the identity pose obtains poor performances. We added this analysis in the updated version of the Appendix (C.3) and refered to it in the main paper.\\n\\n_I do not expected all concerns be addressed, but I would like to see if author can enhance the baseline, and clarify the experiment settings._\\n\\nWe hope ours answers regarding the experiment settings as well as the homography baselines we added in the updated version of the paper will address your concerns.\",\n",

    "            \" We would like to thank reviewer BNXs for his/her comments. Please find our answers below:\\n\\n- _(1) Authors admitted that the proposed method can only produce low resolution correspondence_: We would like to highlight that it is not the method itself that limits the resolution, but the implementation choices we had to make to train a network on 16GB memory GPUs in a reasonable amount of time (less than 24 hours in our case). By relaxing some of these constraints, there exists simple ways to significantly increase the resolution, such as gradient checkpointing (reduces the memory footprint but increases the training time) or using GPUs with larger memory.\\n  \\n- _(2) Is there any explanation why correspondence inpainting is harder for inpainting?_: We believe the inpainted correspondence maps are less peaked than the outpainted correspondence maps because outpainting a correspondent essentially consists in transferring the features from location $p_{s,i}$ in the source features to location $p_{t,i}$ in the target features to obtain $d_{s,i} = D_{T,pad} (p_{t,i})$ (please refer to figure 2 to understand these notations). In the inpainting case, $p_{s,i}$ is occluded by an object in the target image, and this object is (often) also visible in the source image at location $p_{s,occ}$ . Thus, to produce peaked correspondence maps for both $p_s$ and $p_{s,occ}$ , the network has to output features such that $d_{s,i} = D_{T,pad} (p_{t,i}) = d_{s,occ} $ which is more difficult than just $d_{s,i} = D_{T,pad} (p_{t,i})$. We added this paragraph in the updated version of the Appendix (Section A.2).\\n  \\n- _(3) Did authors define how to compute Kc for transforming points from image plane to correspondence plane? It seems that I am not able to find it in the main manuscript._: We left out that computational detail from the manuscript. $K_c$ simply corresponds to a rescaled and offsetted transformation of the original calibration matrix, found by changing the focal length and offsetting the principal point of the camera. We added the analytical formula to compute $K_c$ in the Appendix (Section C.1).\\n\\n- _(4) It would be better if authors could provide more analysis and ablation study on the relationship between accuracy of camera pose estimation and distribution of hallucinated correspondence. And in which case, hallucinated correspondence will be more accurate or less accurate._: We would like to highlight that we performed an analysis in that direction in section B.2 where we report the percentage of camera poses being correctly estimated for several values of $\\\\gamma$, which demonstrates the benefits of outpainting with a large $\\\\gamma$ for camera pose estimation. In Figure 6 we also showed that learning to inpaint does not bring any significant improvement. Outpainting improves the camera pose because outpainted correspondences are outside the field of view and thus complement the identified correspondences, and thus better constrain the camera pose estimate. On the contrary, inpainted correspondences are usually surrounded by identified correspondences, thus the information they provide is redundant and does not allow to better constrain the camera pose estimate. We added this analysis in the Appendix (Section B.3).\\n\\n- _(5) Authors should also cite several other related work for feature matching_: Thank you for pointing out these missing references, they have been added to the updated version of the paper.\\n\\nWe took into account the suggestions from all three reviewers and updated our submission accordingly.\\nWe also uploaded a video demonstrating the generalization performances of NeurHal on both indoor and outdoor smartphone-captured videos in the supplementary material.\",\n",
    "            \" We would like to thank reviewer nobf for his/her comments. Please find our answers below:\\n\\n- _The proposed method has limited technique contribution. For example, the original NRE [Germain 2021] is able to predict outpainting correspondences (it gives an extra category for un-matched keypoints). As a result, this paper adapts [Germain 2021] to solve this problem_: We would like to highlight that [Germain 2021] is **not** able to predict outpainting correspondences. They do consider an extra category for un-matched keypoints but the probability for that category is set to **zero**, ie. the network does not output any score for that category (it is stated in section 3 of [Germain 2021]: \\\"By definition, $C_{Q,n} (p_n^Q = out) := 0.$\\\"). Setting this probability to zero is due to the fact that [Germain 2021] considers a classical siamese CNN architecture that does not allow the features of both images to communicate. [Germain 2021] is what we called, in the introduction, a \\\"pure pattern recognition approach\\\". Moreover, even if [Germain 2021] were using a non-siamese architecture, their method would output a single score for the category \\\"un-matched keypoint\\\" which would allow the network to detect when the correspondent is not visible but would not be sufficient to outpaint the **location** of the correspondent.\\n\\n- _In figure 3, the baseline (uniform correspondence map) is too weak_:  Figure 3 illustrates the difference in NRE distributions for different kinds of hallucinated correspondences. In this plot the uniform distribution label is not a baseline, but merely an indicator which serves as a reference point to interpret the NRE values and argmax distances. Comparison against state-of-the-art methods (baselines) can be seen in Figure 4. \\n\\n- _In figure 4, I do not find the precision for identified keypoints. It is unfair for the other methods._: As stated in the section \\\"contributions\\\", our paper seeks to answer to the question: \\\"Can we derive a network architecture able to learn to hallucinate correspondences?\\\". Thus in Figure 4, we evaluated the performances on inpainting and outpainting to highlight that sota methods are not able to hallucinate correspondences while NeurHal can. We already know that all these methods are very good at identifying correspondences. In Figure 3, we did compute the identification histograms of NeurHal to highlight/compare the difficulty of inpainting and outpainting with respect to the task of identification.\\n\\n- _In camera pose estimation (section 4.2), the description of the baseline (correspondent to the first (light blue) method in figure 6) is not clear to me._: The baseline of Figure 6 corresponds to training our model using only identifiable (ie. covisible) keypoint correspondences. The other curves incorporate additional training data coming from non-covisible correspondences (inpainting and outpainting). We have made this clearer in the updated version of the paper.\\n\\n- _So, it is hard to tell if the proposed method is able to improve the state-of-the-art camera pose estimation methods._: Our experiments on absolute camera pose estimation demonstrate our method (trained jointly on identified, inpainted and outpainted correspondences) is indeed able to significantly improve the state-of-the-art, in the case of low-overlap image pairs (please see Figure 7, 12 and 13). Could you please specify why Figure 7, 12 and 13 do not clearly demonstrate the improvement of NeurHal over the state-of-the-art camera pose estimation methods?\\n\\n- _[...] improve the baselines, and compare with the state-of-the-art camera pose estimation methods._: To the best of our knowledge we did compare against the state-of-the-art camera pose estimation methods (LoFTR, DRCNet, SP+SG, R2D2, S2D). These are the best performing methods on visual localization benchmarks (e.g. [visuallocalization.net](https://www.visuallocalization.net/)).\\n\\nWe took into account the suggestions from all three reviewers and updated our submission accordingly.\\nWe also uploaded a video demonstrating the generalization performances of NeurHal on both indoor and outdoor smartphone-captured videos in the supplementary material.\",\n",
    "            \" We would like to thank reviewer uCMw for his/her comments. Please find our answers below:\\n\\n- _It is unclear to me what the network actually learns. I speculate that it learns to warp the source image to the target given the relative pose between the two cameras and the depth of the keypoint in the source image. The output of this process is a correspondence map, which suggests that multiple warpings are considered. This is not described clearly enough._: We agree with this analysis. However as you correctly pointed out, this is a \\\"speculation\\\" as there is no proof the network is actually doing this, so at the time of submission we decided not write anything about it. As requested, we updated our submission and added a paragraph in the Appendix (Sec A.2).\\n\\n- _The metrics used for evaluation are somewhat arbitrary, or not sufficiently justified. [...]  Camera pose estimation is considered correct when the rotation error is under 20 degrees and the translation error is under 1.5 m. The latter is uninformative without knowing the magnitude of the translation between the two cameras_: We agree that the choice of our thresholds are arbitrary, in fact the choice of thresholds in visual localization benchmarks is rarely backed by statistical evidence. In order to show that our thresholds are not too loose,  we reported in Figure 13 the performance of NeurHal, state-of-the-art feature matching methods and the identity pose, on ScanNet for several rotation and translation thresholds. We can see that 1.5m is not an \\\"easy\\\" threshold because the identity pose obtains poor performances.

    "            \"The paper proposes a method that accepts two partially overlapping images and a keypoint in one of them, and detects the location of the keypoint in the other image, regardless of whether it is visible, occluded, or outside the frame of the image. This is an interesting re-formulation of the correspondence estimation problem, the conventional formulation of which considers only keypoints that are visible in both images. Under the previous formulation, correspondence estimators are considered successful if they can declare that the correspondent of the keypoint is invisible in the target image. In addition to the capability to predict the location of invisible keypoints in isolation, the paper demonstrates that this capability is beneficial to camera pose estimation. *Strengths*\\n\\nThe capability to predict the location of points that have just become occluded or exited the frame is useful in many tasks, such as perception for robots where such predictions could guide the robot\\u2019s next moves. Humans are good at this, but computer vision research has focused on the limited setting when the keypoints are visible in both images. Loss functions used for training networks for correspondence estimation only consider descriptors of visible keypoints. This is an important contribution of the paper and it goes beyond more qualitative work of predicting unseen objects based on context.\\n\\nThe approach builds upon the concept of Neural Reprojection Error (NRE) which was recently introduced by Germain et al. (2021). NRE does not require that the appearance of two image regions, that are hypothesized to be projections of the same 3D point, is similar. It can be viewed as an extension of the purely geometric reprojection error. Germain et al. did not consider occluded or out-of-bounds keypoints.\\n\\nI consider the unified treatment of visible, occluded and out-of-bounds keypoints an advantage.\\n\\nExperiments are thorough, findings are explained clearly, and limitations of the proposed method are pointed out. I consider the use of four publicly available datasets, two indoor and two outdoor, sufficient. Over one million keypoints are used in the experiments.\\n\\nGeneralization on additional datasets not used for training is also shown. This is important since it allows broader deployment of the algorithm.\\n\\nThe main limitation of NeurHal is low accuracy under favorable conditions, due to the low resolution of its output. (Improving this is left as a direction for future work.) \\n\\nThe appendices contain useful additional information, experiments and implementation details. \\n\\n*Weaknesses*\\n\\nIt is unclear to me what the network actually learns. I speculate that it learns to warp the source image to the target given the relative pose between the two cameras and the depth of the keypoint in the source image. The output of this process is a correspondence map, which suggests that multiple warpings are considered. This is not described clearly enough. (The fact that the visibility of keypoint in the target images does not need to be labeled is clear.)\\n\\nThe metrics used for evaluation are somewhat arbitrary, or not sufficiently justified. Figure 3, for example, compares the results to random chance, which is a very weak baseline. Camera pose estimation is considered correct when the rotation error is under 20 degrees and the translation error is under 1.5 m. The latter is uninformative without knowing the magnitude of the translation between the two cameras. 1.5 m may be a very small or a very large error depending on the input data.\\n\\n\\n*Other Comments*\\n\\nI find the term hallucination in the title marginally acceptable, but I think that it is abused in the rest of the paper. For example in: \\u201cLocal feature matching methods are only able to identify the correspondent\\u2019s location when it is visible, while humans can also hallucinate its location when it is occluded or outside the field of view through geometric reasoning.\\u201d Humans do not hallucinate, they predict or estimate. \\n\\nFootnote 1 on p. 3 is unnecessary. The equation it refers to holds for any images in general configuration sharing the same intrinsic parameters (K matrix). The latter constraint can be easily relaxed.\\n\\nSection 3.2: the calibration matrix K_c does not encode the boundaries of the image. Instead of a different matrix, what is needed are different boundary conditions for considering pixels to be within the image or not.\\n\\nSection A.2 that discusses additional related work should be moved to the main paper. It is very relevant to the problem at hand.\\n\\nFigure 8: precision on the y-axis is perplexing. The description suggests that this should be recall.\\n\\n The paper contains an important contribution as discussed above. The fact that predicting the locations of invisible points improves camera pose estimation provides further support that the method is useful in downstream tasks. \",\n",
    "            \"The paper proposed a deep method (NeurHal) to predict visible, occluded or out-of-view keypoint matching from source images to target images. In training, a correspondence map is obtained from ground truth of camera matrix/pose, and images. In testing, the model directly outputs three categories of matchings: identified, outputpainting and inpainting. As an application of NeurHal, the method is applied to camera pose estimation and tested on ScanNet and Megadepth. The experiments shows the method improves the estimation accuracy, particularly the outputpainting correspondences.  Strengths:\\n+The paper proposed an new problem: if and how neural network can predict unseen scene (keypoints) from a source-target image pair. Human is able to heuristically guess the location of outpainting correspondences from the geometry. For example, the keypoint displacement is relative camera pose and scene depth. This paper uses a deep model to accomplish this goal.\\n+ The paper proposed a method that is based on correspondence map and neural reprojection error [Germain 2021] with sufficient details.\\n+ NeurHal is tested on public datasets for precision of correspondences and camera pose estimation, showing better result than baselines.\\n\\nWeakness:\\n- The proposed method has limited technique contribution. For example, the original NRE [Germain 2021]  is able to predict outpainting correspondences (it gives an extra category for un-matched keypoints). As a result, this paper adapts [Germain 2021] to solve this problem.\\n- In figure 3, the baseline (uniform correspondence map) is too weak. In figure 4, I do not find the precision for identified keypoints. It is unfair for the other methods.\\n- In camera pose estimation (section 4.2), the description of the baseline (correspondent to the first (light blue) method in figure 6) is not clear to me. Because some methods highly rely on good correspondences but others are not. So, it is hard to tell if the proposed method is able to improve the state-of-the-art camera pose estimation methods.    I tend to reject the paper because of the lack of contribution in technique and insufficient experiments. I would like to see \\n1. the technique differences, compared with [Germain 2021] .\\n2. improve the baselines, and compare with the state-of-the-art camera pose estimation methods.\",\n",
    "            \"In this manuscript, authors proposed a new problem of correspondence hallucination, in which for keypoint in the source image, its correspondence should be detected regardless if it is occluded or outside the field of view. In particular, the authors proposed a new model and training paradigm that learn to hallucinate correspondence by predicting its probability distribution of its location. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks demonstrated that proposed method  can help camera pose estimation and outperforms prior state of the art feature matching approaches.\\n Strengths:\\n(1) This work provides an interesting research direction correspondence learning, in which occluded and out of FoV correspondence can also help large-baseline camera pose estimation.\\n(2) Based on this insight: authors proposed a new model for hallucinating the correspondence based on attention blocks.\\n(3) Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor benchmarks demonstrated that proposed model is able to hallucinate correspondence and outperform prior SoTA on wide baseline setting in terms of camera poes estimation.\\n(4) Author provided detailed supplementary material and trained model and source code for better supporting reproducibility.\\n\\nWeakness:\\n(1) Authors admitted that the proposed method can only produce low resolution correspondence, which can have a negative impact on localization accuracy. \\n(2) Is there any explanation why correspondence inpainting is harder for inpainting?\\n(3) Did authors define how to compute Kc for transforming points from image plane to correspondence plane? It seems that I am not able to find it in the main manuscript.\\n(4) It would be better if authors could provide more analysis and ablation study on the relationship between accuracy of camera pose estimation and distribution of hallucinated correspondence. And in which case, hallucinated correspondence will be more accurate or less accurate.\\n(5) Authors should also cite several other related work for feature matching:\\nLearning feature descriptors using camera pose supervision, ECCV 2020\\nSelf-Supervised Geometric Perception, CVPR 2021\\nPatch2Pix: Epipolar-Guided Pixel-Level Correspondences, CVPR 2021\\n In summary, based on the strength and weakness I mentioned, I like this paper's idea for hallucinating correspondence so that we can obtain better accuracy for camera pose estimation, although it would be better to have more analysis and ablation study for the impact of correspondence hallucination on camera pose estimation accuracy.\"\n",

Justify the use of different thresholds in Figure 7 (1.5m and 20\\n^o) compared to the score board ((0.25m, 2\\n^o) / (0.5m, 5\\n^o) / (5m, 10\\n^o)), especially the larger angular error threshold. Experiments are thorough. The use of four publicly available datasets is sufficient. Generalization on additional datasets not used for training is shown. However, low accuracy under favorable conditions due to the low resolution of the output is a limitation. The baseline (uniform correspondence map) in figure 3 is too weak. Precision for identified keypoints is missing in figure 4. Description of the baseline in camera pose estimation (section 4.2) is unclear. Experiments on camera pose estimation need to be compared with state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms prior state-of-the-art feature matching approaches.',\n",
       " 'Significance': 'The proposed method is able to predict the location of correspondences for improving camera localization quality The capability to predict the location of points that have just become occluded or exited the frame is useful in many tasks. The unified treatment of visible, occluded and out-of-bounds keypoints is an advantage. Predicting the locations of invisible points improves camera pose estimation. The paper proposes a new problem: predicting unseen scene keypoints from image pairs. The work provides an interesting research direction in correspondence learning, where occluded and out-of-FoV correspondence can help with large-baseline camera pose estimation. The proposed method can potentially lead to better accuracy for camera pose estimation.',\n",
       " 'Novelty': \"The technical contribution is sufficient This is an interesting re-formulation of the correspondence estimation problem. The paper's approach builds upon the concept of Neural Reprojection Error (NRE) and extends it to handle occluded or out-of-bounds keypoints. It goes beyond more qualitative work of predicting unseen objects based on context. Limited technique contribution as the original NRE [Germain 2021] can also predict outpainting correspondences. The paper adapts [Germain 2021] to solve this problem. The paper proposes a new problem of correspondence hallucination. The authors proposed a new model for hallucinating the correspondence based on attention blocks.\"}"

      "Abstract: Given a pair of partially overlapping source and target images and a keypoint in the source image, the keypoint's correspondent in the target image can be either visible, occluded or outside the field of view. Local feature matching methods are only able to identify the correspondent's location when it is visible, while humans can also hallucinate its location when it is occluded or outside the field of view through geometric reasoning. In this paper, we bridge this gap by training a network to output a peaked probability distribution over the correspondent's location, regardless of this correspondent being visible, occluded, or outside the field of view. We experimentally demonstrate that this network is indeed able to hallucinate correspondences on pairs of images captured in scenes that were not seen at training-time. We also apply this network to an absolute camera pose estimation problem and find it is significantly more robust than state-of-the-art local feature matching-based competitors.\n",

      "Abstract: Complex visual hallucinations are known to occur in individuals with impaired vision yet whose emotional and intellectual functions are within the normal range. These hallucinations, which were first reported by Charles Bonnet in 1760, have been described in many case studies, but have not been analyzed empirically to determine their major properties. In the present study, sixty complex hallucinators labeled as Charles Bonnet hallucinators were administered a questionnaire to determine the properties of their hallucinations. Combined use of multiple-correspondence analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis reveals a set of features that characterize the ‘typical’ Charles Bonnet hallucinatory experience: the hallucinators' experience occurs while they are alert and with the eyelids open; a sharply focused image appears suddenly, without any apparent trigger or voluntary control; the hallucination is present for seconds, does not move during this time, then suddenly vanishes. These features are discussed in terms of a ‘dimension’ of hallucinatory/perceptual experience, which ranges from discrete perceptual experiences to multiple, changing experiences. Possible mechanisms that underlie the Charles Bonnet hallucinations are discussed.\n",

      "Authors: Yujiao Shi, Xin Yu, Shanhe Wang, Hongdong Li\n",
      "Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of Cross-view Video-based camera Localization (CVL). The task is to localize a query camera by leveraging information from its past observations, i.e., a continuous sequence of images observed at previous time stamps, and matching them to a large overhead-view satellite image. The critical challenge of this task is to learn a powerful global feature descriptor for the sequential ground-view images while considering its domain alignment with reference satellite images. For this purpose, we introduce CVLNet, which first projects the sequential ground-view images into an overhead view by exploring the ground-and-overhead geometric correspondences and then leverages the photo consistency among the projected images to form a global representation. In this way, the cross-view domain differences are bridged. Since the reference satellite images are usually pre-cropped and regularly sampled, there is always a misalignment between the query camera location and its matching satellite image center. Motivated by this, we propose estimating the query camera's relative displacement to a satellite image before similarity matching. In this displacement estimation process, we also consider the uncertainty of the camera location. For example, a camera is unlikely to be on top of trees. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we collect satellite images from Google Map for the KITTI dataset and construct a new cross-view video-based localization benchmark dataset, KITTI-CVL. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of video-based localization over single image-based localization and the superiority of each proposed module over other alternatives.\n",

      "Abstract: Pose detection of objects is an important topic in object-level mapping and indoor localization. In the past, pose estimation methods were performed either with the help of artificial markers or natural features found on the object. However, due to the fact that the markers can only be utilized in controlled environment experiments, the application of marker-based approaches is very limited. Furthermore, methods that depend on the object's natural visual features require texture on the object and lack robustness to illumination and camera viewpoint variations. With the advent of Deep Learning (DL), the classical pose estimation methods have been outperformed. The DL-based pose estimation can detect deep features of the object and exhibits higher robustness to many distortions and variabilities caused by the changes in the illumination and viewpoint conditions. However, the massive training data set requirement is the main challenge with most DL-based methods. The training set is often a real set of images that have been manually labeled or annotated. In addition, such methods face problems related to the degradation of their predicted accuracy in the presence of uncertainties due to the symmetrical structure of many objects. To address the aforementioned issues, a novel and very fast method for generating synthetic data, as well as a contour-based technique for accurate pose estimation (that can handle pose ambiguities for a symmetrical object) are proposed in this paper. The tests that are conducted in multiple indoor scenarios demonstrate not only the effectiveness of the synthetic data generation but also exhibit, in many cases, the very high accuracy of the proposed pose estimation method.\n",

      "Abstract: Labelling multiple people across various camera views is fundamentally challenging, because of severe occlusion, complex scenes, and changing visibility observed from various viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve the occlusion problem for cross-view labelling based on pairs of images. To solve the multiple people matching problem while severe occlusion occurs, we introduce a novel keypoint-based correspondence component between different people, in order to overcome the mis-alignment of multi-view geometry and locate the proper cross-view correspondence when occlusion occurs. Based on the keypoint component, correct correspondence can be rectified, thus obtaining accurate multi-view distance. To further enhance the performance for cross-view labelling, we incorporate pre-trained appearance features and multi-view constraints to achieve multiple people matching. Pairwise score strategy is also applied to increase the labelling accuracy. Experimental results verify the superior performance of the proposed method on challenging multi-view multiple people datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n",

      "Authors: Shuo Dai, Tao Bai, Yunjie Zhao\n",
      "Abstract: With the development of intelligent modern agriculture, strawberry harvesting robots play an increasingly important role in precision agriculture. However, existing vision systems face multiple challenges in complex farmland environments, including fruit occlusion, difficulties in recognizing fruits at varying ripeness levels, and limited real-time processing capabilities. This study proposes a keypoint detection and 3D localization method for strawberry fruits utilizing a depth camera to address these challenges. By introducing a Haar Wavelet Downsampling (HWD) module and Gold-YOLO neck, the proposed method achieves significant improvements in feature extraction and detection performance. The integration of the HWD module effectively reduces image noise, enhances feature extraction accuracy, and strengthens the method’s ability to recognize fruit stems. Additionally, incorporating the Gold-YOLO neck structure enhances multi-scale feature fusion, improving detection accuracy and enabling the method to adapt to complex environments. To further accelerate inference speed and enable deployment in an embedded system, Layer-adaptive sparsity for Magnitude-based Pruning (LAMP) technology is employed, significantly reducing redundant parameters and thereby enhancing the lightweight performance of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify strawberries at different ripeness stages and exhibits strong robustness under various lighting conditions and complex scenarios, achieving an average precision of 97.3% while reducing model parameters to 38.2% of the original model, significantly improving the efficiency of strawberry fruit localization. This method provides robust technical support for the practical application and widespread adoption of agricultural robots.\n",

While none of these papers specifically mention AMCPG-A/B or compare them directly to REINFORCE, they provide a strong theoretical basis for the critique that the original paper's evaluation is limited and that broader evaluations are needed.\n",

      "Final Answer:Several research papers discuss the limitations of evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms within a single game environment and advocate for evaluations across multiple domains to ensure generalizability. While specific comparisons of AMCPG-A/B to REINFORCE in diverse games are not explicitly found, the general principle of needing diverse evaluations is well-supported.

The critiques about minor technical contributions and lack of specific strategies to tackle self-supervised image generation suggest that DRAW might be considered an earlier or less sophisticated approach compared to more recent advancements. The interpretability limitations are a common concern in many deep learning models, and DRAW may suffer from this more acutely than some other models. The critique regarding the approach not being well-situated in the context of advancements in self-supervised vectorization suggests that DRAW's approach may not be aligned with current research directions. To fully support or contradict these critiques, a more in-depth analysis of DRAW and its comparison to more modern self-supervised learning techniques would be needed. The survey papers identified provide a good starting point for such analysis.\u001b[0m\n",

To unify different modalities, we tokenize inputs and outputs - images, text, audio, action, bounding boxes etc., into a shared semantic space and then process them with a single encoder-decoder transformer model. Since training with such diverse modalities is challenging, we propose various architectural improvements to stabilize model training. We train our model from scratch on a large multimodal pre-training corpus from diverse sources with a multimodal mixture of denoisers objective. To learn an expansive set of skills, such as following multimodal instructions, we construct and. finetune on an ensemble of 120 datasets with prompts and augmentations. With a single unified model, Unified-io 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GRIT benchmark and strong results in more than 35 benchmarks, including image generation and understanding, natural language understanding, video and audio understanding, and robotic manipulation. We release all our models to the research community.\n",

      "Abstract: Generating automatic dense captions for videos that accurately describe their contents remains a challenging area of research. Most current models require processing the entire video at once. Instead, we propose an efficient, online approach which outputs frequent, detailed and temporally aligned captions, without access to future frames. Our model uses a novel autoregressive factorized decoding architecture, which models the sequence of visual features for each time segment, outputting localized descriptions and efficiently leverages the context from the previous video segments. This allows the model to output frequent, detailed captions to more comprehensively describe the video, according to its actual local content, rather than mimic the training data. Second, we propose an optimization for efficient training and inference, which enables scaling to longer videos. Our approach shows excellent performance c\u001b[0m\n",

However, some of the papers might include those comparisons within the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the information gathered, here's a summary addressing the critiques:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Aliasing Effects:** The paper \"Fix your downsampling ASAP! Be natively more robust via Aliasing and Spectral Artifact free Pooling\" directly addresses aliasing in neural networks. This paper suggests that aliasing is a significant issue and proposes a solution. The critique that aliasing effects are visible on the BAIR dataset, leading to artifacts like \"blocky\" vegetables on the Kinetics dataset, is supported by this research.\n",
      "*   **Underfitting:** The critique that aliasing points to underfitting is a plausible connection. Aliasing can arise from insufficient model capacity to capture high-frequency details, which could be interpreted as a form of underfitting.\n",
      "*   **Comparison to SVG, SAVP, SV2P:** Finding a direct comparison of these models on Kinetics or BAIR has been difficult. Further, more focused searches or a literature review might be needed.\n",
      "*   **Evaluation on Video Prediction vs. Generation:** The critiques question why the proposed approach is only evaluated on video prediction and not generation. Video prediction is a specific task where the model predicts future frames given a sequence of past frames. Video generation is a more general task where the model generates new video sequences, potentially conditioned on some input. Evaluating on both tasks would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's capabilities.\n",
      "*   **Perplexity of Kinetics Models:** The critique questions the lower perplexity of Kinetics models compared to BAIR. Perplexity is a measure of how well a probability distribution predicts a sample. A lower perplexity generally indicates better prediction. The difference could be due to the nature of the datasets, the complexity of the scenes, or the specific architectures used.\n",
      "*   **Limited Dataset Comparisons:** The critique points out that the proposed model is only compared with state-of-the-art models on the BAIR Robot Pushing dataset and only compared with variations of the proposed model on the KINETICS dataset. This limits the generalizability of the results.\n",
      "*   **Reporting Metrics:** The critique mentions the choice of Bits/dim and FVD over PSNR and SSIM. While all these metrics are used, PSNR and SSIM are more traditional pixel-wise metrics, whereas FVD is designed to better capture the perceptual quality and temporal coherence of videos. The choice depends on the focus of the research.\n",
      "*   **Single-Frame Priming:** The critique questions the use of only a single prime frame. Using longer priming sequences is more common because they provide more context for the model to make predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer:Based on the research, aliasing is a recognized problem in video prediction and can lead to visible artifacts. The choice of evaluation metrics and dataset comparisons is a valid point of critique that impacts the generalizability of the conclusions. Further research is needed to directly compare the performance of SVG, SAVP, and SV2P on the BAIR and Kinetics datasets, and to justify the design choices regarding priming frames and evaluation tasks.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Abstract: The main objective of this research is to create a more secure and user-friendly password-generation method that is less vulnerable to attacks such as shoulder surfing. Similarly, while textual or alphanumeric passwords are not entirely secure, they also come with certain limitations, including issues related to memory. The novelty of this research is the development of a new algorithm (Secure Password Algorithm/SPA) for password generation that uses graphics to generate textual input from users based on user perceptions. This method is more resilient against attacks like shoulder surfing and offers a more secure and user-friendly way of creating passwords. This research uses a combination of literature review and SPA proposals to create passwords with graphical and encryption techniques. The literature review examines the weaknesses of existing graphical and text password methods. The proposed algorithm focuses on user perception and confidential data to create more secure and easy-to-use passwords. The research results show that this research can provide a new, more secure, and user-friendly method of generating passwords such as shoulder surfing. Research supports software implementation of these algorithms and psychometric, psychological, and psychiatric studies to improve user input and protect systems from malicious attacks. Graphical passwords provide better recall compared to textual passwords, and the proposed algorithm for password generation using graphical and encryption techniques provides a more secure and user-friendly method of password generation that is less vulnerable to attacks such as shoulder surfing. The proposed new encryption algorithm has succeeded in overcoming various potential weaknesses and attacks on previous encryption methods. The test results demonstrate the efficiency and near invulnerability of the SPA algorithm against brute force attacks on specific security parameters. Tested alongside AES, shows comparable security levels, particularly in resource-constrained environments. To address doubts, the paper establishes evaluation standards for computational complexity, resistance to known attacks, and adaptability to evolving threats. The algorithm has the potential to be a stronger and more secure solution for generating passwords to safeguard confidential user information.\n",

      "Abstract: \n",
      " Identification of diseases affecting the optic nerve is paramount in ophthalmology. Traditional diag nostic methods often rely heavily on manual intervention, leading to potential errors and delays. Consequently, there’s a pressing need for automated systems capable of early disease detection to initiate timely treatment, thereby averting permanent vision impairment. Glaucoma, a chronic eye condition with the potential for irreversible blindness, stands as a prime example. Recent strides in deep learning have revolutionized the diagnosis of glaucoma through the analysis of retinal fundus images. These technologies enable the development of algorithms capable of identifying subtle signs indicative of glaucoma, often imperceptible to the human eye. By harnessing vast datasets, these algorithms can learn to distinguish between healthy and diseased retinas with remarkable accuracy, facilitating early intervention and treatment. The novelty of the work comes from the combination of existing machine learning techniques on tabular datasets as well as deep learning image segmentation to increase the performance compared to using any one technique alone. The proposed methodology for glaucoma diagnosis makes use of a combination of a deep learning model and several machine l\u001b[0m\n",

      "Abstract: Intelligent agents can learn to represent the action spaces of other agents simply by observing them act. Such representations help agents quickly learn to predict the effects of their own actions on the environment and to plan complex action sequences. In this work, we address the problem of learning an agent's action space purely from visual observation. We use stochastic video prediction to learn a latent variable that captures the scene's dynamics while being minimally sensitive to the scene's static content. We introduce a loss term that encourages the network to capture the composability of visual sequences and show that it leads to representations that disentangle the structure of actions. We call the full model with composable action representations Composable Learned Action Space Predictor (CLASP). We show the applicability of our method to synthetic settings and its potential to capture action spaces in complex, realistic visual settings. When used in a semi-supervised setting, our learned representations perform comparably to existing fully supervised methods on tasks such as action-conditioned video prediction and planning in the learned action space, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer action labels.

      "Authors: Marti A. Hearst\n",
      "Abstract: Bernhard Schölkopf, GMD First Is there anything worthwhile to learn about the new SVM algorithm, or does it fall into the category of “yet-another-algorithm,” in which case readers should stop here and save their time for something more useful? In this short overview, I will try to argue that studying support-vector learning is very useful in two respects. First, it is quite satisfying from a theoretical point of view: SV learning is based on some beautifully simple ideas and provides a clear intuition of what learning from examples is about. Second, it can lead to high performances in practical applications. In the following sense can the SV algorithm be considered as lying at the intersection of learning theory and practice: for certain simple types of algorithms, statistical learning theory can identify rather precisely the factors that need to be taken into account to learn successfully. Real-world applications, however, often mandate the use of more complex models and algorithms—such as neural networks—that are much harder to analyze theoretically. The SV algorithm achieves both. It constructs models that are complex enough: it contains a large class of neural nets, radial basis function (RBF) nets, and polynomial classifiers as special cases. Yet it is simple enough to be analyzed mathematically, because it can be shown to correspond to a linear method in a high-dimensional feature space nonlinearly related to input space. Moreover, even though we can think of it as a linear algorithm in a high-dimensional space, in practice, it does not involve any computations in that high-dimensional space. By the use of kernels, all necessary computations are performed directly in input space. This is the characteristic twist of SV methods—we are dealing with complex algorithms for nonlinear pattern recognition, 1 regression, 2 or feature extraction,3 but for the sake of analysis and algorithmics, we can pretend that we are working with a simple linear algorithm. I will explain the gist of SV methods by describing their roots in learning theory, the optimal hyperplane algorithm, the kernel trick, and SV function estimation. For details and further references, see Vladimir Vapnik’s authoritative treatment, 2 he collection my colleagues and I have put together, 4 and the SV Web page at http://svm. first.gmd.de.\n",

      "Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning-based wearable human action recognition (wHAR) have improved the capture and classification of complex motions, but adoption remains limited due to the lack of expert annotations and domain discrepancies from user variations. Limited annotations hinder the model's ability to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. While data augmentation can improve generalizability, unsupervised augmentation techniques must be applied carefully to avoid introducing noise. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses domain discrepancies by aligning conditional distributions with labeled target samples, but vanilla pseudo-labeling can lead to error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose μDAR, a novel joint optimization architecture comprised of three functions: (i) consistency regularizer between augmented samples to improve model classification generalizability, (ii) temporal ensemble for robust pseudo-label generation and (iii) conditional distribution alignment to improve domain generalizability. The temporal ensemble works by aggregating predictions from past epochs to smooth out noisy pseudo-label predictions, which are then used in the conditional distribution alignment module to minimize kernel-based class-wise conditional maximum mean discrepancy (kCMMD) between the source and target feature space to learn a domain invariant embedding. The consistency-regularized augmentations ensure that multiple augmentations of the same sample share the same labels; this results in (a) strong generalization with limited source domain samples and (b) consistent pseudo-label generation in target samples. The novel integration of these three modules in μDAR results in a range of ~ 4-12% average macro-F1 score improvement over six state-of-the-art UDA methods in four benchmark wHAR datasets.\n",

      "Abstract: With the rapidly increasing video data, many video analysis techniques have been developed and achieved success in recent years. To mitigate the distribution bias of video data across domains, unsupervised video domain adaptation (UVDA) has been proposed and become an active research topic. Nevertheless, existing UVDA methods need to access source domain data during training, which may result in problems of privacy policy violation and transfer inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel source-free temporal attentive domain adaptation (SFTADA) method for video action recognition under the more challenging UVDA setting, such that source domain data is not required for learning the target domain. In our method, an innovative Temporal Attentive aGgregation (TAG) module is designed to combine frame-level features with varying importance weights for video-level representation generation. Without source domain data and label information in the target domain and during testing, an MLP-based attention network is trained to approximate the attentive aggregation function based on class centroids. By minimizing frame-level and video-level loss functions, both the temporal and spatial domain shifts in cross-domain video data can be reduced. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiven\u001b[0m\n",

      "*   **\"Scarcity of action-labeled data not a real concern\"**: While some papers explore unsupervised or self-supervised learning to mitigate the need for labeled data, the general trend indicates that action-labeled data is still valuable, especially in the context of domain adaptation.

      "Abstract: Federated learning methods enable model training across distributed data sources without data leaving their original locations and have gained increasing interest in various fields. However, existing approaches are limited, excluding many structured probabilistic models. We present a general and elegant solution based on structured variational inference, widely used in Bayesian machine learning, adapted for the federated setting. Additionally, we provide a communication-efficient variant analogous to the canonical FedAvg algorithm. The proposed algorithms' effectiveness is demonstrated, and their performance is compared with hierarchical Bayesian neural networks and topic models.\n",

      "Authors: Vidhi Lalchand, Aditya Ravuri, Neil D. Lawrence\n",
      "Abstract: Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVM) are a ﬂexible and non-linear approach to dimensionality reduction, extending classical Gaussian processes to an unsupervised learning context. The Bayesian incarna-tion of the GPLVM [Titsias and Lawrence, 2010] uses a variational framework, where the posterior over latent variables is approxi-mated by a well-behaved variational family, a factorised Gaussian yielding a tractable lower bound. However, the non-factorisability of the lower bound prevents truly scalable inference. In this work, we study the doubly stochastic formulation of the Bayesian GPLVM model amenable with minibatch training. We show how this framework is compatible with diﬀerent latent variable formulations and perform experiments to compare a suite of models. Further, we demonstrate how we can train in the presence of massively missing data and obtain high-ﬁdelity reconstructions. We demonstrate the model’s performance by benchmark-ing against the canonical sparse GPLVM for high dimensional data examples. work contributes a scalable method of inference for Bayesian GPLVM models used for non-parametric, probabilistic dimensionality reduction. Unsupervised learning tasks involving high-dimensional data are ubiquitous in the modern world. Some concrete examples are single-cell RNA data, ﬁnancial time-series and medical records.\n",

      "Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions. They have been applied to both regression and non-linear dimensionality reduction, and offer desirable properties such as uncertainty estimates, robustness to over-fitting, and principled ways for tuning hyper-parameters. However the scalability of these models to big datasets remains an active topic of research. \n",

      "We introduce a novel re-parametrisation of variational inference for sparse GP regression and latent variable models that allows for an efficient distributed algorithm. This is done by exploiting the decoupling of the data given the inducing points to re-formulate the evidence lower bound in a Map-Reduce setting. \n",

      "We show that the inference scales well with data and computational resources, while preserving a balanced distribution of the load among the nodes. We further demonstrate the utility in scaling Gaussian processes to big data. We show that GP performance improves with increasing amounts of data in regression (on flight data with 2 million records) and latent variable modelling (on MNIST). The results show that GPs perform better than many common models often used for big data.\n",

      "Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Deep Learning (DL) models in various applications, testing DL models is vitally important. However, testing DL models is costly and expensive, e.g., manual labelling is widely-recognized to be costly. To reduce testing cost, we propose to select only a subset of testing data, which is small but representative enough for a quick estimation of the performance of DL models. Our approach, DeepReduce, adopts a two-phase strategy. At first, our approach selects testing data for the purpose of satisfying testing adequacy. Then, it selects more testing data to approximate the distribution between the whole testing data and the selected data by leveraging relative entropy minimization. We evaluate DeepReduce on four widely-used datasets (with 15 models in total). We find that DeepReduce reduces the whole testing data to 7.5% on average and can reliably estimate the performance of DL models.\n",

      "Abstract: Given the integrated circuits (IC) production scale, the amount of process control monitoring (PCM) data enable to develop an efficient algorithm for IC yield prediction at the die-level. Therefore, in addition to cost-effective and time-efficient yield evaluation, the proposed model is able to identify failed dice and low-yield areas on a wafer without any direct electrical die testing. Additionally, for non-parametric random dice failure detection that are untraceable by PCM input based models, an ensemble learning including both PCM and die defect inspection data are described. As Wafer Sort (WS) consumes a lot of time and resources with high associated cost a significant cost reduction can be achieved using smart product routing with selective WS by employing the aforementioned die level predictive model.\n",

      "Abstract: Background Chest X-rays (CXRs) are widely used for cost-effective screening of active pulmonary tuberculosis despite their limitations in sensitivity and specificity when interpreted by clinicians or radiologists. To address this issue, computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms, particularly deep learning architectures based on convolution, have been developed to automate the analysis of radiography imaging. Deep learning algorithms have shown promise in accurately classifying lung abnormalities using chest X-ray images. In this study, we utilized the EfficientNet B4 model, which was pre-trained on ImageNet with 380x380 input dimensions, using its weights for transfer learning, and was modified with a series of components including global average pooling, batch normalization, dropout, and a classifier with 12 image-wise and 44 segment-wise lung zone evaluation classes using sigmoid activation. Objectives Assess the clinical usefulness of our previously created EfficientNet B4 model in identifying lung zone-specific abnormalities related to active tuberculosis through an observer performance test involving a skilled clinician operating in tuberculosis-specific environments. Methods The ground truth was established by a radiologist who examined all sample CXRs to identify lung zone-wise abnormalities. An expert clinician working in tuberculosis-specific settings independently reviewed the same CXR with blinded access to the ground truth. Simultaneously, the CXRs were classified using the EfficientNet B4 model. The clinician's assessments were then compared with the model's predictions, and the agreement betw\u001b[0m\n",

      "Abstract: This report is based on a course of the same name given at Stanford University during autumn quarter, 1987. Here's the catalog description: CS 209. Mathematical Writing—Issues of technical writing and the effective presentation of mathematics and computer science. Preparation of theses, papers, books, and \" literate \" computer programs. A term paper on a topic of your choice; this paper may be used for credit in another course. The first three lectures were a \" minicourse \" that summarized the basics. About two hundred people attended those three sessions, which were devoted primarily to a discussion of the points in §1 of this report. An exercise (§2) and a suggested solution (§3) were also part of the minicourse. The remaining 28 lectures covered these and other issues in depth. We saw many examples of \" before \" and \" after \" from manuscripts in progress. We learned how to avoid excessive subscripts and superscripts. We discussed the documentation of algorithms, computer programs, and user manuals. We considered the process of refereeing and editing. We studied how to make effective diagrams and tables, and how to find appropriate quotations to spice up a text. Some of the material duplicated some of what would be discussed in writing classes offered by the English department, but the vast majority of the lectures were devoted to issues that are specific to mathematics and/or computer science. were a special highlight as each of these outstanding authors presented their own perspectives on the problems of mathematical communication. This report contains transcripts of the lectures and copies of various handouts that were distributed during the quarter. We think the course was able to clarify a surprisingly large number of issues that play an important part in the life of every professional who works in mathematical fields. Therefore we hope that people who were unable to attend the course might still benefit from it, by reading this summary of what transpired. The authors wish to thank Phyllis Winkler for the first-rate technical typing that made these notes possible. Caveat: These are transcripts of lectures, not a polished set of essays on the subject. Some of the later lectures refer to mistakes in the notes of earlier lectures; we have decided to correct some (but not all) of those mistakes before printing this report.

During nighttime, he trod the unpaved road of computer programming and compiler writing. Both roads intersected! -- as Knuth discovered while reading Noam Chomsky's book Syntactic Structures on his honeymoon in 1961. \"Chomsky theories fascinated me, because they were mathematical yet they could also be understood with my programmer's intuition. It was very curious because otherwise, as a mathematician, I was doing integrals or maybe was learning about Fermat's number theory, but I wasn't manipulating symbols the way I did when I was writing a compiler. With Chomsky, wow, I was actually doing mathematics and computer science simultaneously.\" How, when, and why did mathematics and computing converge for Knuth?

      "Abstract: The present work presents an analysis of the neighborhood criterion for the prototype selection (PS) in supervised machine learning classification algorithms. To do this, we use the condensed neighbor algorithm CNN to eliminate redundant data with the normalization of the distance to the centroid of each data subset criterion. This is done, in order to obtain the training matrix of the most optimal model. A selection of neighborhood criterion has been created from the quantification of the balance between the performance of the classification and the reduction of data set (CER). As proof of the test, we performed: (i) CER and (ii) real-time tests with the implementation of the algorithm within the WSN. The result is a data reduction of up to 88 % and a performance of the kNN classifier of 75%. It is concluded that the criterion of neighborhood with normalized distance must be less than or equal to 0.2 and the implementation of kNN with k = 1 obtains the best CER.\n",

      "Abstract: The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play an eminent role in identifying the complexities of brain activities. It provides a monitoring method to record the electrical activity of the brain. This paper deals with the various channel selection techniques for selecting the subset of channels. We have provided the various dimensionality reduction techniques which can reduce the computational cost and engross the training of the model. Firstly, this paper will go through the variety of channel selection algorithms and then it will use those channel compression techniques. We have worked on PCA, ICA, LDA, and various types of DCT waves. We have proposed a unique algorithm for classification of signals which resulted in the accuracy of 92% on test data. The course for making a distribution contains various stages: (a) Preprocessing of a signal, (b) Channel Selection, (c) Applying compression algorithms to reduce the dimension of the dataset and\n",

      "Authors: M. D. Sai Krishna Mohan, T. Shashank, M. Vaishnavi, J. S. Devi\n",
      "Abstract: Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems are mostly being used for authentication of a known identity based on different voice features. The ASV involves a comparison of a speaker's voice with pre-stored training data or speaker model captured during the enrolment phase and also with an impersonator model of non-identical voices differing in gender as well as phone types. Thereafter, a score is assigned by the system and decides whether the test speaker is an enrolled speaker or an imposter. In the comprehensive classification of a certain problem, one of the most important processes is feature subset selection. It includes dimensionality reduction, attribute subset selection and variable subset selection and also an important step to reduce overfitting of data. This paper presents one of the methods to solve this feature selection problem using Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. This algorithm subsumes the performance of the classification into state transition rule. The optimal feature set is determined with the help of the pheromone from the ant colony. Finally, a feature set with maximum classification accuracy and small size is selected.\n",

      "Abstract: The advancement of generative radiance fields has pushed the boundary of 3D-aware image synthesis. Motivated by the observation that a 3D object should look realistic from multiple viewpoints, these methods introduce a multi-view constraint as regularization to learn valid 3D radiance fields from 2D images. Despite the progress, they often fall short of capturing accurate 3D shapes due to the shape-color ambiguity, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. In this work, we address this ambiguity by proposing a novel shading-guided generative implicit model that is able to learn a starkly improved shape representation. Our key insight is that an accurate 3D shape should also yield a realistic rendering under different lighting conditions. This multi-lighting constraint is realized by modeling illumination explicitly and performing shading with various lighting conditions. Gradients are derived by feeding the synthesized images to a discriminator. To compensate for the additional computational burden of calculating surface normals, we further devise an efficient volume rendering strategy via surface tracking, reducing the training and inference time by 24% and 48%, respectively.

      "Abstract: Despite being at the focal point of intense research in both computer graphics as well as in computer vision, accurately reproducing the shape and appearance of real-world scenes remains a challenging problem, especially under uncontrolled conditions. One cue that has been used to separate diffuse and specular reflectance is polarization. Recent work in computer graphics has explored polarization of incident illumination in conjunction with spherical gradient illumination to infer high quality diffuse-specular separation of both albedo as well as photometric normal information [Ma et al. 2007]. Ghosh et al. [2010] improved upon this by removing the view-dependence of the polarization scheme of Ma et al. by analyzing the Stokes reflectance field under incident circularly polarized spherical gradient illumination, and recover more detailed specular reflectance information including index of refraction as well as specular roughness.\n",

      "Abstract: In this study we investigate the viewpoint dependency of complex facial expressions versus simple facial motions (so-called “action units” [Ekman and Friesen 1978]). The results not only shed light on the cognitive processes underlying the processing of complex and simple facial motion for expression recognition, but also suggest ways how to incorporate these results into computer graphics and computer animation [Breidt et al. 2003]. For example, expression recognition might be highly viewpoint dependent making it difficult to recognize expressions from the side. As a direct consequence, modeling of expressions would then require only the frontal views to “look good”, i.e., it would in principle be unnecessary to attempt detailed 3D modeling of expressions. If, however, recognition of expressions were view-invariant, then modeling would have to provide a faithful 3D rendering of facial expressions.\n",

      "Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) has become a cornerstone in modern computer graphics, enabling realistic material representation and lighting interactions in 3D scenes. In this paper, we present MaterialMVP, a novel end-to-end model for generating PBR textures from 3D meshes and image prompts, addressing key challenges in multi-view material synthesis. Our approach leverages Reference Attention to extract and encode informative latent from the input reference images, enabling intuitive and controllable texture generation. We also introduce a Consistency-Regularized Training strategy to enforce stability across varying viewpoints and illumination conditions, ensuring illumination-invariant and geometrically consistent results. Additionally, we propose Dual-Channel Material Generation, which separately optimizes albedo and metallic-roughness (MR) textures while maintaining precise spatial alignment with the input images through Multi-Channel Aligned Attention. Learnable material embeddings are further integrated to capture the distinct properties of albedo and MR. Experimental results demonstrate that our model generates PBR textures with realistic behavior across diverse lighting scenarios, outperforming existing methods in both consistency and quality for scalable 3D asset creation.\n",

      "Action Input: Generating temporally coherent high fidelity video is an important milestone in generative modeling research. We make progress towards this milestone by proposing a diffusion model for video generation that shows very promising initial results. Our model is a natural extension of the standard image diffusion architecture, and it enables jointly training from image and video data, which we find to reduce the variance of minibatch gradients and speed up optimization. To generate long and higher resolution videos we introduce a new conditional sampling technique for spatial and temporal video extension that performs better than previously proposed methods. We present the first results on a large text-conditioned video generation task, as well as state-of-the-art results on established benchmarks for video prediction and unconditional video generation.

      "Abstract: In this paper, a novel digital video resolution enhancement algorithm based on adaptive directional interpolation is proposed, where the directionality of the edge structure and the nonlocal self-similarity prior within the current frame as well as its adjacent frames are both considered. First, we establish the regularization equation that conforms to the prior model of a video frame and then take the classic bicubic interpolation result as the initial estimation to iteratively solve the restoration equation, in which the edge structures and contours in low resolution (LR) input are reconstructed to estimate and refine the desired high resolution (HR) output. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance the clarity of a video frame, with satisfying subjective visual quality and PSNR value.\n",

      "Authors: Redouane Lhiadi, Abdessamad Jaddar, A. Kaaouachi\n",
      "Abstract: Video processing is essential in entertainment, surveillance, and communication. This research presents a strong framework that improves video clarity and decreases bitrate via advanced restoration and compression methods. The suggested framework merges various deep learning models such as super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, and frame interpolation, in addition to a competent compression model. Video frames are first compressed using the libx265 codec in order to reduce bitrate and storage needs. After compression, restoration techniques deal with issues like noise, blur, and loss of detail. The video restoration transformer (VRT) uses deep learning to greatly enhance video quality by reducing compression artifacts. The frame resolution is improved by the super-resolution model, motion blur is fixed by the deblurring model, and noise is reduced by the denoising model, resulting in clearer frames. Frame interpolation creates additional frames between existing frames to create a smoother video viewing experience. Experimental findings show that this system successfully improves video quality and decreases artifacts, providing better perceptual quality and fidelity. The real-time processing capabilities of the technology make it well-suited for use in video streaming, surveillance, and digital cinema.\n",

      "Abstract: Prevalent state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods fall into a query-based scheme, in which instance masks are derived by querying the image feature using a set of instance-aware embeddings. In this work, we devise a new training framework that boosts query-based models through discriminative query embedding learning. It explores two essential properties, namely dataset-level uniqueness and transformation equivariance, of the relation between queries and instances. First, our algorithm uses the queries to retrieve the corresponding instances from the whole training dataset, instead of only searching within individual scenes. As querying instances across scenes is more challenging, the segmenters are forced to learn more discriminative queries for effective instance separation. Second, our algorithm encourages both image (instance) representations and queries to be equivariant against geometric transformations, leading to more robust, instance-query matching. On top of four famous, query-based models ($i.e.,$ CondInst, SOLOv2, SOTR, and Mask2Former), our training algorithm provides significant performance gains ($e.g.,$ +1.6 - 3.2 AP) on COCO dataset. In addition, our algorithm promotes the performance of SOLOv2 by 2.7 AP, on LVISv1 dataset.\n",

      "Abstract: The high-consequence area (HCA) is crucial for the safety management and operation of oil and gas pipelines. However, traditional models that rely on manual field investigations are costly, inefficient, and risky. Deep learning (DL)-based instance segmentation (IS) has the potential to enable automatic HCA identification. Unfortunately, the existing studies lack methods specifically designed to identify HCAs from remote sensing (RS) images. This letter proposes an IS network (HCA-Net) with spatial relation enhancement and mask decoupling refinement for HCA recognition is proposed. The proposed method first develops a spatial relation enhancement module (SREM) that queries the similarity of features at different spatial locations to represent spatial relations, further enhancing these features to promote completeness. Moreover, a unique decoupled mask refinement head (DMRH) is designed to refine the mask by decoupling boundary features from body features and optimally integrating them into the final features. Experiments on the constructed gas pipeline aerial dataset (GPAD) show that our method outperforms eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to the baseline model mask R-CNN, HCA-Net improves the mAP of masks and the mIoU of HCA by 3.9% and 6.9%, respectively.\n",

We define localized content-based image retrieval as a CBIR task where the user is only interested in a portion of the image, and the rest of the image is irrelevant. We presents three new localized CBIR systems, each of which deals with a different task and retrieval scenario. \n",

The second paper focuses on unsupervised meta-learning for reinforcement learning. The third paper discusses reinforcement learning algorithms for sequential experimental design. None of these papers directly address the need for clarity in reporting experimental details. It seems unlikely that I will find a paper that directly addresses the specific question about Alice and Bob's iterations.

      "\n",
      "Based on the search results, I can address the critiques as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Lack of strong self-play baseline:** The TavilySearch results confirm the importance of baselines in machine learning experiments. They highlight that baselines help in understanding the task, discovering inconsistencies, setting performance benchmarks, and evaluating more complex models. This supports the critique about the lack of a strong self-play baseline.\n",
      "2.  **Need for additional experiments on the same domains as prior work for performance comparison:** While I couldn't find a paper explicitly stating this, the general principle of controlled experiments in machine learning supports this critique. For a fair comparison, experiments should be conducted on the same domains and with the same setup as prior work.\n",
      "3.  **Clarity needed on whether plots track combined iterations of Alice and Bob, or just Bob:** This is a matter of clear reporting and experimental design. While no specific paper addresses this exact point, the general principle of clarity in experimental design is essential for reproducibility and understanding.\n",
      "Final Answer: The critiques are supported by general principles of machine learning experimentation. The importance of strong baselines is documented in multiple sources, and the need for fair comparisons with prior work on the same domains stems from the need for controlled experiments. Clarity in experimental design, while not explicitly addressed in a single paper about Alice and Bob's iterations, is a fundamental principle for reproducibility and understanding.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Abstract: The goal of imitation learning is to mimic expert behavior from demonstrations, without access to an explicit reward signal. A popular class of approach infers the (unknown) reward function via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) followed by maximizing this reward function via reinforcement learning (RL). The policies learned via these approaches are however very brittle in practice and deteriorate quickly even with small test-time perturbations due to compounding errors. We propose Imitation with Planning at Test-time (IMPLANT), a new meta-algorithm for imitation learning that utilizes decision-time planning to correct for compounding errors of any base imitation policy. In contrast to existing approaches, we retain both the imitation policy and the rewards model at decision-time, thereby benefiting from the learning signal of the two components. Empirically, we demonstrate that IMPLANT significantly outperforms benchmark imitation learning approaches on standard control environments and excels at zero-shot generalization when subject to challenging perturbations in test-time dynamics.\n",

      "Abstract: We consider the Imitation Learning (IL) setup where expert data are not collected on the actual deployment environment but on a different version. To address the resulting distribution shift, we combine behavior cloning (BC) with a planner that is tasked to bring the agent back to states visited by the expert whenever the agent deviates from the demonstration distribution. The resulting algorithm, POIR, can be trained offline, and leverages online interactions to efficiently fine-tune its planner to improve performance over time. We test POIR on a variety of human-generated manipulation demonstrations in a realistic robotic manipulation simulator and show robustness of the learned policy to different initial state distributions and noisy dynamics.\n",

      "Abstract: Robust lane-changing behavior planning is critical to ensuring the safety and comfort of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we proposed an efficient and robust vehicle lane-changing behavior decision-making method based on reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) initialization which learns the potential lane-changing driving mechanisms from driving mechanism from the interactions between vehicle and environment, so as to simplify the manual driving modeling and have good adaptability to the dynamic changes of lane-changing scene. Our method further makes the following improvements on the basis of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm: (1) A dynamic hybrid reward mechanism for lane-changing tasks is adopted; (2) A state space construction method based on fuzzy logic and deformation pose is presented to enable behavior planning to learn more refined tactical decision-making; (3) An RL initialization method based on imitation learning which only requires a small amount of scene data is introduced to solve the low efficiency of RL learning under sparse reward. Experiments on the SUMO show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the test on the CARLA simulator also verifies the generalization ability of the method.\n",

      "Authors: Farid Badfar, A. Safavi\n",
      "Abstract: The convergence and stability of uncertain nonlinear systems is a challenging problem in the nonlinear control area. Besides, in many practical cases, all states are not measurable and are affected by measurement noise. Based on this motivation, the first objective of this paper is to design a novel output feedback robust model predictive control approach for nonlinear systems with state‐ and input‐dependent uncertainties and measurement noise. This approach combines state estimation and robust model predictive control (MPC) into one min–max optimization and by solving the optimization, these two tasks are performed simultaneously. The studied nonlinear system comprises a linear part, a nonlinear part, and a function that denotes the state‐ and input‐dependent uncertainties. Therefore, the other objective is to reduce the computational complexity; thus, the system's nonlinear term and the aforementioned uncertainties are converted into additional disturbances. Subsequently, the optimization problem becomes a quadratic form, which leads to global convergence with the appropriate selection of objective function weights. Besides, this paper explores the convergence of the closed‐loop system states and the sufficient synthesis conditions to guarantee input‐to‐state stability. The implementation on a numerical example and a CSTR process demonstrate the applicability and reliability of the proposed approach.\n",

      "Abstract: In control system networks, reconfiguration of the controller when agents are leaving or joining the network is still an open challenge, in particular when operation constraints that depend on each agent's behavior must be met. Drawing our motivation from mobile robot swarms, in this paper, we address this problem by optimizing individual agent performance while guaranteeing persistent constraint satisfaction in presence of bounded communication range and time-varying network topology. The approach we propose is a model predictive control (MPC) formulation, building on multi-trajectory MPC (mt-MPC) concepts. To enable plug and play operations when the system is in closed-loop without the need of a request, the proposed MPC scheme predicts two different state trajectories in the same finite horizon optimal control problem. One trajectory drives the system to the desired target, assuming that the network topology will not change in the prediction horizon, while the second one ensures constraint satisfaction assuming a worst-case scenario in terms of new agents joining the network in the planning horizon. Recursive feasibility and stability of the closed-loop system during plug and play operations are shown. The approach effectiveness is illustrated with a numerical simulation.\n",

The main work of this paper is to optimize the energy consumption of heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings based on economic model predictive control (EMPC). The cost in EMPC design includes energy consumption and predicted mean vote (PMV), which is an index that evaluates the thermal comfort of indoor occupants.

      "Authors: Johannes Lehmann, Bill Gaskins\n",
      "Abstract: Examining scientific creativity through the lens of artistic practice may allow identification of a path towards an institutional environment that explicitly values and promotes transformative creativity in science. It is our perception as an artist and natural scientist that even though creativity is valued in the sciences, it is not institutionally promoted to the same extent it is in the arts. Acknowledging creativity as acts of transformation and central to scientific pursuit, actively utilizing chance and failure in scientific experimentation, are critical for step changes in scientific knowledge. Iterative and open-ended processes should be modeled after insights from a range of practices in the visual, performing and media arts. Successful institutional implementation requires training through a long-term process of unlearning and learning, organizing interactions to critique results, designing experiments to contain trial and error, and building common and individual spaces that promote chance encounters across disciplines and with non-academic sectors. As a natural scientist and an artist, we call for bringing such a transformative creative approach into scientific practice as a guiding principle for organizational and cultural development of the university. https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-019-0308-8 OPEN 1 School of Integrative Plant Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. 2 Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. 3 Institute for Advanced Studies, Technical University Munich, Garching, Germany. 4 Department of Art, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. 5 Photographic & Electronic Media, Lazarus Graduate Center, Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, MD 21212, USA.

For the longest time, science was rather associated with discovery of what is already there than actual creation (Barasch, 1985). It is telling that the word ‘creativity’ only appeared about one hundred years ago (Whitehead, 1978) and for the most part stayed in the realm of artistic production, despite the close relationship of art and science noted by many contemporary scientists (Root-Bernstein et al., 2008). Even Goethe considered his scientific theory of colors (Fig. 1) his greatest achievement, not his poetry, illustrating how close artistic and scientific pursuit may align. Yet in natural science, you are taught the answer, in arts, the questions, process and material production. From our point of view as an artist and a natural scientist, we strongly argue that close observation of artistic creativity (Collingwood, 1937), defined as ideas and actions that transform laws, principals, materials, and thoughts both of the artist and the audiences, can be informative for scientific progress. Important lessons about educating for and promoting creativity in the sciences can, in our experience, be learned from studying the creative process in the arts. The following comments collate our thoughts from an artistic and natural science point of view. Framing the issue Both arts and sciences rely on a foundation of mastering methods and conceptual tools that require familiarity with the norm in order to question it. As much as a visual artist has to comprehend and engage the histories of visual, cultural, conceptual and social questions of the past and present, and deal with fundamental laws and skills governing the conception, production and reception of visual art, the scientist must have a basis in, \u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe Semantic Scholar search returned a paper about creativity in arts and sciences, which is irrelevant to the query. It seems a direct search for critiques of the IMPLANT method is not yielding relevant results. I will try a broader search focusing on the novelty of MPC and learned reward functions in imitation learning, and then filter for papers that discuss limitations or criticisms.\n",

Various selective synaptic plasticity approaches have been recently proposed to preserve network parameters, which are crucial for previously learned tasks while learning new tasks.

      "Authors: P. Sahu, N. Hemachandra\n",
      "Abstract: We investigate optimal posteriors for recently introduced \\cite{begin2016pac} chi-squared divergence based PAC-Bayesian bounds in terms of nature of their distribution, scalability of computations, and test set performance. For a finite classifier set, we deduce bounds for three distance functions: KL-divergence, linear and squared distances. Optimal posterior weights are proportional to deviations of empirical risks, usually with subset support. For uniform prior, it is sufficient to search among posteriors on classifier subsets ordered by these risks. We show the bound minimization for linear distance as a convex program and obtain a closed-form expression for its optimal posterior. Whereas that for squared distance is a quasi-convex program under a specific condition, and the one for KL-divergence is non-convex optimization (a difference of convex functions). To compute such optimal posteriors, we derive fast converging fixed point (FP) equations. We apply these approaches to a finite set of SVM regularization parameter values to yield stochastic SVMs with tight bounds. We perform a comprehensive performance comparison between our optimal posteriors and known KL-divergence based posteriors on a variety of UCI datasets with varying ranges and variances in risk values, etc. Chi-squared divergence based posteriors have weaker bounds and worse test errors, hinting at an underlying regularization by KL-divergence based posteriors. Our study highlights the impact of divergence function on the performance of PAC-Bayesian classifiers. We compare our stochastic classifiers with cross-validation based deterministic classifier. The latter has better test errors, but ours is more sample robust, has quantifiable generalization guarantees, and is computationally much faster.\n",

      "Authors: Jiaming Lv, Haoyuan Yang, Peihua Li\n",
      "Abstract: Since pioneering work of Hinton et al., knowledge distillation based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Div) has been predominant, and recently its variants have achieved compelling performance. However, KL-Div only compares probabilities of the corresponding category between the teacher and student while lacking a mechanism for cross-category comparison. Besides, KL-Div is problematic when applied to intermediate layers, as it cannot handle non-overlapping distributions and is unaware of geometry of the underlying manifold. To address these downsides, we propose a methodology of Wasserstein Distance (WD) based knowledge distillation. Specifically, we propose a logit distillation method called WKD-L based on discrete WD, which performs cross-category comparison of probabilities and thus can explicitly leverage rich interrelations among categories. Moreover, we introduce a feature distillation method called WKD-F, which uses a parametric method for modeling feature distributions and adopts continuous WD for transferring knowledge from intermediate layers. Comprehensive evaluations on image classification and object detection have shown (1) for logit distillation WKD-L outperforms very strong KL-Div variants; (2) for feature distillation WKD-F is superior to the KL-Div counterparts and state-of-the-art competitors.

      "Abstract: Distances are pervasive in machine learning. They serve as similarity measures, loss functions, and learning targets; it is said that a good distance measure solves a task. When defining distances, the triangle inequality has proven to be a useful constraint, both theoretically--to prove convergence and optimality guarantees--and empirically--as an inductive bias. Deep metric learning architectures that respect the triangle inequality rely, almost exclusively, on Euclidean distance in the latent space. Though effective, this fails to model two broad classes of subadditive distances, common in graphs and reinforcement learning: asymmetric metrics, and metrics that cannot be embedded into Euclidean space. To address these problems, we introduce novel architectures that are guaranteed to satisfy the triangle inequality. We prove our architectures universally approximate norm-induced metrics on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and present a similar result for modified Input Convex Neural Networks. We show that our architectures outperform existing metric approaches when modeling graph distances and have a better inductive bias than non-metric approaches when training data is limited in the multi-goal reinforcement learning setting.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Obesity is one of the most serious public health concerns worldwide. Considering the multifactorial nature and increasing prevalence of obesity, many techniques have been proposed for its treatment, ranging from behavioral interventions to surgeries, but they are often ineffective, invasive, and costly. Furthermore, relapse and weight regain are common. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques hold promise for modulating food-related brain processes and functions in these patients, potentially through increasing top-down control in response to food cue that supports reduction in calorie intake. Previous ﬁndings revealed that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a target site related to executive functions that support cognitive control of food craving, modulates the reward–control balance towards facilitation of cognitive control and possibly suppression of reward-related mechanisms that drive food cue-induced craving. However, understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms of tDCS over DLPFC on the brain networks of food craving remains largely unknown. Thus, an experimental clinical trial investigating the modulatory effects of tDCS over food cue-reactivity seems promising. Method: The NeuroStim-Obesity trial is a prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind single session tDCS trial targeting food craving in those with obesity. Once randomized, a total of 64 subjects (age range 18–61 years) with obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI) between 25-35 kg/m2) complete one session in which they receive either active or sham tDCS over the DLPFC. Active tDCS consisted of 2 mA of current applied continuously for 20 minutes with the anode placed over F4 and the cathode over F3 according to the 10–20 EEG system. The primary outcome is change in neural response to the food cue-reactivity task in the ventral striatum after a single session bilateral tDCS compared to sham stimulation. Secondary outcomes include changes in food craving evaluated by Food Craving Questionnaire-State (FCQ-S). We will also explore the predictive role of brain structural and functional networks assessed by structural, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during both task performance and the resting-state that are acquired pre- and post-intervention to predict response to tDCS.Discussion: The results will provide novel insight into neuroscience for the efficacy of tDCS and will advance the field towards precision medicine for obesity. Exploratory results will examine the potential predictive biomarkers for tDCS response, and eventually to provide personalized intervention for treatment of obesity.Trial registration: This trial was retrospectively registered at Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) Identiﬁer: IRCT20121020011172N4 at June 4, 2020, https://www.irct.ir/trial/45482.

      "Abstract: We introduce a new diffusion-based approach for shape completion on 3D range scans. Compared with prior deterministic and probabilistic methods, we strike a balance between realism, multi-modality, and high fidelity. We propose DiffComplete by casting shape completion as a generative task conditioned on the incomplete shape. Our key designs are two-fold. First, we devise a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism to inject conditional features in a spatially-consistent manner. So, we can capture both local details and broader contexts of the conditional inputs to control the shape completion. Second, we propose an occupancy-aware fusion strategy in our model to enable the completion of multiple partial shapes and introduce higher flexibility on the input conditions. DiffComplete sets a new SOTA performance (e.g., 40% decrease on l_1 error) on two large-scale 3D shape completion benchmarks. Our completed shapes not only have a realistic outlook compared with the deterministic methods but also exhibit high similarity to the ground truths compared with the probabilistic alternatives. Further, DiffComplete has strong generalizability on objects of entirely unseen classes for both synthetic and real data, eliminating the need for model re-training in various applications.\n",

      "Abstract: We propose a 3D shape generation framework (SDF-Diffusion in short) that uses denoising diffusion models with continuous 3D representation via signed distance fields (SDF). Unlike most existing methods that depend on discontinuous forms, such as point clouds, SDF-Diffusion generates high-resolution 3D shapes while alleviating memory issues by separating the generative process into two-stage: generation and super-resolution. In the first stage, a diffusion-based generative model generates a low-resolution SDF of 3D shapes. Using the estimated low-resolution SDF as a condition, the second stage diffusion model performs super-resolution to generate high-resolution SDF. Our framework can generate a high-fidelity 3D shape despite the extreme spatial complexity. On the ShapeNet dataset, our model shows competitive performance to the state-of-the-art methods and shows applicability on the shape completion task without modification.\n",

      "Abstract: 3D shape generation aims to produce innovative 3D content adhering to specific conditions and constraints. Existing methods often decompose 3D shapes into a sequence of localized components, treating each element in isolation without considering spatial consistency. As a result, these approaches exhibit limited versatility in 3D data representation and shape generation, hindering their ability to generate highly diverse 3D shapes that comply with the specified constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial-aware 3D shape generation framework that leverages 2D plane representations for enhanced 3D shape modeling. To ensure spatial coherence and reduce memory usage, we incorporate a hybrid shape representation technique that directly learns a continuous signed distance field representation of the 3D shape using orthogonal 2D planes. Additionally, we meticulously enforce spatial correspondences across distinct planes using a transformer-based autoencoder structure, pro\u001b[0m\n",

Thus, we propose PatchComplete, which learns effective shape priors based on multi-resolution local patches, which are often more general than full shapes (e.g., chairs and tables often both share legs) and thus enable geometric reasoning about unseen class categories. To learn these shared substructures, we learn multi-resolution patch priors across all train categories, which are then associated to input partial shape observations by attention across the patch priors, and finally decoded into a complete shape reconstruction. Such patch-based priors avoid overfitting to specific train categories and enable reconstruction on entirely unseen categories at test time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic ShapeNet data as well as challenging real-scanned objects from ScanNet, which include noise and clutter, improving over state of the art in novel-category shape completion by 19.3% in chamfer distance on ShapeNet, and 9.0% for ScanNet.\n",

      "Abstract: We approach the problem of understanding how people interact with each other in collaborative settings, especially when individuals know little about their teammates, via Multiagent Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL), where the goal is to infer the reward functions guiding the behavior of each individual given trajectories of a team's behavior during some task. Unlike current MIRL approaches, we do not assume that team members know each other's goals a priori; rather, that they collaborate by adapting to the goals of others perceived by observing their behavior, all while jointly performing a task. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to MIRL via Theory of Mind (MIRL-ToM). For each agent, we first use ToM reasoning to estimate a posterior distribution over baseline reward profiles given their demonstrated behavior. We then perform MIRL via decentralized equilibrium by employing single-agent Maximum Entropy IRL to infer a reward function for each agent, where we simulate the behavior of other teammates according to the time-varying distribution over profiles. We evaluate our approach in a simulated 2-player search-and-rescue operation where the goal of the agents, playing different roles, is to search for and evacuate victims in the environment. Our results show that the choice of baseline profiles is paramount to the recovery of the ground-truth rewards, and that MIRL-ToM is able to recover the rewards used by agents interacting both with known and unknown teammates.\n",

      "Authors: Kyriacos Shiarlis, J. Messias, Shimon Whiteson\n",
      "Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) allows autonomous agents to learn to solve complex tasks from successful demonstrations. However, in many settings, e.g., when a human learns the task by trial and error, failed demonstrations are also readily available. In addition, in some tasks, purposely generating failed demonstrations may be easier than generating successful ones. Since existing IRL methods cannot make use of failed demonstrations, in this paper we propose inverse reinforcement learning from failure (IRLF) which exploits both successful and failed demonstrations. Starting from the state-of-the-art maximum causal entropy IRL method, we propose a new constrained optimisation formulation that accommodates both types of demonstrations while remaining convex. We then derive update rules for learning reward functions and policies. Experiments on both simulated and real-robot data demonstrate that IRLF converges faster and generalises better than maximum causal entropy IRL, especially when few successful demonstrations are available.\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose – This purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the theoretical background and applications of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL).Design/methodology/approach – Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques provide a powerful solution for sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. RL uses an agent equipped with a reward function to find a policy through interactions with a dynamic environment. However, one major assumption of existing RL algorithms is that reward function, the most succinct representation of the designer's intention, needs to be provided beforehand. In practice, the reward function can be very hard to specify and exhaustive to tune for large and complex problems, and this inspires the development of IRL, an extension of RL, which directly tackles this problem by learning the reward function through expert demonstrations. In this paper, the original IRL algorithms and its close variants, as well as their recent advances are reviewed and compared.Findings – This pape...\n",

      "Abstract: With the research and development of deep reinforcement learning, the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world problems such as game and optimization decision, and intelligent driving has also made significant progress. However, reinforcement learning has difficulty in manually designing the reward function in the interaction between an agent and its environment, so researchers have proposed the research direction of inverse re-inforcement learning (IRL). How to learn reward functions from expert demonstrations and perform strategy optimization is a novel and important research topic with very important research implications in the field of artificial intelligence. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the recent progress of inverse reinforcement learning algorithms. Firstly, new advances in the theory of inverse reinforcement learning are introduced, then the challenges faced by inverse reinforcement learning and the future development trends are analyzed, and finally the progress and application prospects of inverse reinforcement learning are discussed\n",

      "Abstract: Program synthesis or code generation aims to generate a program that satisfies a problem specification. Recent approaches using large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) have shown promising results, yet they have some critical limitations. In particular, they often follow a standard supervised fine-tuning procedure to train a code generation model only from the pairs of natural-language problem descriptions and ground-truth programs. Such paradigm largely ignores some important but potentially useful signals in the problem specification such as unit tests, which thus often results in poor performance when solving complex unseen coding tasks. To address the limitations, we propose\"CodeRL\", a new framework for program synthesis tasks through pretrained LMs and deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, during training, we treat the code-generating LM as an actor network, and introduce a critic network that is trained to predict the functional correctness of generated programs and provide dense feedback signals to the actor. During inference, we introduce a new generation procedure with a critical sampling strategy that allows a model to automatically regenerate programs based on feedback from example unit tests and critic scores. For the model backbones, we extended the encoder-decoder architecture of CodeT5 with enhanced learning objectives, larger model sizes, and better pretraining data. Our method not only achieves new SOTA results on the challenging APPS benchmark, but also shows strong zero-shot transfer capability with new SOTA results on the simpler MBPP benchmark.\n",

      "Abstract: Abstract Purpose To uncover the evaluation information on the academic contribution of research papers cited by peers based on the content cited by citing papers, and to provide an evidence-based tool for evaluating the academic value of cited papers. Design/methodology/approach CiteOpinion uses a deep learning model to automatically extract citing sentences from representative citing papers; it starts with an analysis on the citing sentences, then it identifies major academic contribution points of the cited paper, positive/negative evaluations from citing authors and the changes in the subjects of subsequent citing authors by means of Recognizing Categories of Moves (problems, methods, conclusions, etc.), and sentiment analysis and topic clustering. Findings Citing sentences in a citing paper contain substantial evidences useful for academic evaluation. They can also be used to objectively and authentically reveal the nature and degree of contribution of the cited paper reflected by citation, beyond simple citation statistics. Practical implications The evidence-based evaluation tool CiteOpinion can provide an objective and in-depth academic value evaluation basis for the representative papers of scientific researchers, research teams, and institutions. Originality/value No other similar practical tool is found in papers retrieved. Research limitations There are difficulties in acquiring full text of citing papers. There is a need to refine the calculation based on the sentiment scores of citing sentences. Currently, the tool is only used for academic contribution evaluation, while its value in policy studies, technical application, and promotion of science is not yet tested.\n",

      "Authors: J. A. T. Silva, J. Dobránszki\n",
      "Abstract: A recent paper published in JLSC (Bakker & Riegelman, 2018) noted that the retracted status of 40% of 812 records for 144 retracted papers, including as much as 26.3% of the published PDFs, in the mental health field were not clearly indicated as such. Even though a weak visual indication of the retracted status of a retracted paper limits the necessary information available to the public and readership indicating that such literature should no longer be used or cited, there are other reasons why retracted literature continues to be cited. In this commentary, we reflect on additional factors and explain how this might affect bibliometrics and scientometrics, and thus librarianship and education. Moreover, we make proposals for actions that would be necessary to avoid citing retracted papers and efficiently correct the records where retracted papers have been cited. We introduce a prototype concept of the corrected journal impact factor (cJIF) to correct the most widespread journal-based metric, the Clarivate Analytics journal impact factor (JIF), as a possible solution to correct journal-based metrics that may have become distorted by the citation of retracted papers.\n",

      "Abstract: Similar to previous editions, the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), Sixth Edition provides guidelines on all aspects of writing style and formatting for writers, editors, students, and educators within the social and behavioral science professions. In 2006, APA began reviewing and evaluating various documents to explore the changes in publication criteria. After reviewing five years of data, it was determined that revisions were necessary in seven areas: “ethics, journal article reporting standards, reducing bias in language, graphics, writing style, references, and statistics” (APA, 2010, p. XV). Expert committees were established to provide support to the APA Task Force assigned to revising the Publication Manual. The first printing of the Publication Manual was released in July 2009. Even though the new edition of the Publication Manual is nearly 150 pages less than the previous edition, the Publication Manual Revision Task Force has created a manual with style, formatting, and referencing guidelines that are more relevant to resources used by today’s writers. The updated edition includes new sections that discuss how to credit electronic sources, emphasizing the locator information and the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). APA also provides new examples for referencing both electronic and print formats as well as explanations of how to reference software, internet sources, wikis, podcasts, data sets, and other forms of new media. Also new is the added instruction about the structure and content of meta-analyses as well as various checklists to help writers maintain appropriate standards in ethical compliance, create standard tables and figures, and submit manuscripts. APA added new sections within the Publication Manual that describe the criteria for reporting the components of journal articles such as the abstract, methods, statistical results, and discussion sections. They also included new sections discussing methods for ensuring that researchers protect the rights and welfare of participants. The book provides stronger standards for maintaining the participant confidentiality and for reducing bias in language describing participants. For example, the authors suggest that researchers avoid the use of derogatory language such as using “minority” for “non-white” populations.\n",

      "Authors: R. Roth\n",
      "Abstract: ABSTRACT In this article, I review considerations and techniques for approaching cartographic design as visual storytelling. Stories, like maps, are a method for documenting and explaining, for meaningfully abstracting our experiences, for communicating and sharing, and for asserting a particular worldview. I argue that visual storytelling offers an entry point for hybridization in cartography, uniting technology with praxis, product with process, and design with critique while opening rich new avenues for transdisciplinary research and design. I begin by introducing influences on map-based visual storytelling and review ten recurring themes that make visual storytelling different from traditional perspectives on cartographic design. I then offer three of potentially many ways to articulate and organize the design space for map-based visual storytelling: foundational narrative elements and their adaptation to geographic phenomena and processes, visual storytelling genres delineating different story experiences, and visual storytelling tropes used to advance narratives across text, maps, images, and other multimedia. I conclude with a call for future research on visual storytelling in cartography, including visual design, visual ethics, and visual literacy.\n",

      "Authors: Alan Leung\n",
      "Abstract: Parsers – programs that extract structure from strings – are fundamental components of many software systems. Although parsing theory may have found its roots in early work on programming languages, the growth of computing during the intervening decades has expanded the role of parsers into many systems one might not immediately expect: email clients, video games, spreadsheet programs, and relational databases are only a few among myriad examples of systems that extract structured information from input text. As a result, the construction of parsers has become a ubiquitous programming task that is performed by developers across a large spectrum of domains. It is not just a task for programming language experts anymore.Unfortunately, despite over forty years of research on parsing, writing parsers remains a painstaking, manual process that is prone to subtle bugs and pitfalls. Existing tools for generating parsers assume a great deal of background knowledge in parsing and formal language theory, so the learning curve is high.In this dissertation, we argue that it is possible to make parsing more accessible by combining interactive visual feedback with the programming-by-example paradigm, wherein users synthesize programs simply by providing example inputs and outputs demonstrating the result of the intended computation. Towards this aim, we present novel algorithms for (1) constructing syntactic specifications by example, (2) constructing lexical analyses by example, and (3) visualizing progress toward parser completion. We instantiate these algorithms in two graphical development environments we have implemented, Parsify and its successor Parsimony, whose central user interaction paradigm is that of programming-by-example. Finally, via user study we demonstrate that non-expert users indeed show significantly better performance when using our system.\n",

      "Abstract: This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of language models architectures and strategies for\"complex\"question-answering (QA, CQA, CPS) with a focus on hybridization. Large Language Models (LLM) are good at leveraging public data on standard problems but once you want to tackle more specific complex questions or problems (e.g. How does the concept of personal freedom vary between different cultures ? What is the best mix of power generation methods to reduce climate change ?) you may need specific architecture, knowledge, skills, methods, sensitive data protection, explainability, human approval and versatile feedback... Recent projects like ChatGPT and GALACTICA have allowed non-specialists to grasp the great potential as well as the equally strong limitations of LLM in complex QA. In this paper, we start by reviewing required skills and evaluation techniques. We integrate findings from the robust community edited research papers BIG, BLOOM and HELM which open source, benchmark and analyze limits and challenges of LLM in terms of tasks complexity and strict evaluation on accuracy (e.g. fairness, robustness, toxicity, ...) as a baseline. We discuss some challenges associated with complex QA, including domain adaptation, decomposition and efficient multi-step QA, long form and non-factoid QA, safety and multi-sensitivity data protection, multimodal search, hallucinations, explainability and truthfulness, temporal reasoning. We analyze current solutions and promising research trends, using elements such as: hybrid LLM architectural patterns, training and prompting strategies, active human reinforcement learning supervised with AI, neuro-symbolic and structured knowledge grounding, program synthesis, iterated decomposition and others.\n",

      "Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT and BERT, have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling high performance on complex tasks. However, their size and computational needs make LLMs unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices, where efficiency, speed, and low power consumption are critical. Tiny Language Models (TLMs), also known as BabyLMs, offer compact alternatives by using advanced compression and optimization techniques to function effectively on devices such as smartphones, Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and embedded platforms. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of TLM architectures and methodologies, including key techniques such as knowledge distillation, quantization, and pruning. Additionally, it explores potential and emerging applications of TLMs in automation and control, covering areas such as edge computing, IoT, industrial automation, and healthcare. The survey discusses challenges unique to TLMs, such as trade-offs between model size and accuracy, limited generalization, and ethical considerations in deployment. Future research directions are also proposed, focusing on hybrid compression techniques, application-specific adaptations, and context-aware TLMs optimized for hardware-specific constraints. This paper aims to serve as a foundational resource for advancing TLMs capabilities across diverse real-world applications.\n",

Partial least squares (PLS-SEM) was used to test the research model.FindingsFindings indicate that the quality of the hotel websites and mobile apps positively influences telepresence, flow and engagement. Telepresence and flow positively affect the users booking intentions for both the samples. However, for hotel website users, engagement has a no-significant effect on booking intentions. Finally, telepresence has a non-significant effect on flow, and flow has a non-significant effect on engagement for both the users of hotel websites and mobile apps.Originality/valueThis study uses two datasets to understand how hotel booking channel (hotel website and mobile app) quality leads to booking intentions by tapping into telepresence, flow and engagement.\n",

      "Abstract: AURA users’ body composition results are used to provide information regarding the position of individual user’s among the population: for example, if he/she has lower or higher body fat ratio or muscle mass than others. The comparison with other users is good for extra motivation since it creates a competitive element of training or/and diet.1.Can I compare my body composition with AURA users’ body composition results? Brief answer: Yes, you can. In the AURA app we use data based on thousands of AURA Strap measurements conducted by a huge number of our users. All data were processed in order to exclude any incorrect data caused by various factors. As a result the final dataset provides a representation of an actual body composition of AURA users.\n",

      "Abstract: Abstract Data from GPS-based fitness tracker apps have become a prominent source for studying cycling behavior. This type of crowd-sourced data provides larger datasets than were previously attainable by travel surveys and cyclist counts, which allows for the comparison of trip characteristics between geographic regions and the study of temporal trends in bicycle ridership. Researchers acknowledge that different types of biases come with tracking data from fitness tracker apps, such as self-selection bias, which is partially based on different target audiences among fitness tracker apps. This begs the question as to whether the behavior of cyclists, and thus the characteristics of routes traveled, varies among the apps. To provide a first insight into this question, this research analyzes trips reported on three fitness tracker apps, Bikemap, Endomondo, and MapMyFitness, for South Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties) and North Holland. Comparison of trip characteristics is made among the three apps and across both study regions. Results show that cycling behavior observed in the three apps is similar relative to a set of control trips in each region (e.g. fewer primary roads than reference trips observed), but that there are some pronounced differences in trips recorded with the different apps between both regions. This suggests that geographic region plays a role in how trip characteristics reco\u001b[0m\n",

      "Abstract: Evaluation metrics play a vital role in the growth of an area as it defines the standard of distinguishing between good and bad models. In the area of code synthesis, the commonly used evaluation metric is BLEU or perfect accuracy, but they are not suitable enough to evaluate codes, because BLEU is originally designed to evaluate the natural language, neglecting important syntactic and semantic features of codes, and perfect accuracy is too strict thus it underestimates different outputs with the same semantic logic. To remedy this, we introduce a new automatic evaluation metric, dubbed CodeBLEU. It absorbs the strength of BLEU in the n-gram match and further injects code syntax via abstract syntax trees (AST) and code semantics via data-flow. We conduct experiments by evaluating the correlation coefficient between CodeBLEU and quality scores assigned by the programmers on three code synthesis tasks, i.e., text-to-code, code translation, and code refinement. Experimental results show that our proposed CodeBLEU can achieve a better correlation with programmer assigned scores compared with BLEU and accuracy.\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: To develop a semi-automated, AI-assisted workﬂow for segmentation of inﬂammatory lesions on STIR MRI of sacroiliac joints (SIJs) in adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis. Methods: Baseline human performance in manual segmentation of inﬂammatory lesions was ﬁrst established in eight patients with axial spondyloarthritis recruited within a prospective study conducted between April 2018 and July 2019. To improve readers’ consistency a semi-automated procedure was developed, comprising (1) manual segmentation of ‘normal bone’ and ‘disease’ regions (2) automatic segmentation of lesions, i.e., voxels in the disease region with outlying intensity with respect to the normal bone, and (3) human intervention to remove erroneously segmented areas. Segmentation of disease region (subchondral bone) was automated via supervised deep learning; 200 image slices (eight subjects) were used for algorithm training with cross validation, 48 (two subjects) – for testing and 500 (20 subjects) – for evaluation based on visual assessment. The data, code, and model are available at https://github.com/c-hepburn/Bone_MRI . Human and model performance were assessed in terms of Dice coeﬃcient. Results: Intra-reader median Dice coeﬃcients, evaluated from comparison of manual segmentation trials of inﬂamma-tory lesions, were 0.63 and 0.69 for the two readers, respectively. Inter-reader median Dice was in the range of 0.53 to 0.56 and increased to 0.84 using the semi-automated approach. Deep learning model ensemble showed average Dice of 0.94 in subchondral bone segmentation. Conclusions: We describe a semi-automated, AI-assisted workﬂow which improves the objectivity and consistency of radiological segmentation of inﬂammatory load in SIJs.\n",

      "Abstract: Program synthesis aims to create accurate, executable programs from problem specifications, specifically from natural language descriptions in our context. Recent studies have leveraged the power of reinforcement learning (RL) in conjunction with large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing code generation capabilities. The application of RL focuses on directly optimizing for functional correctness, offering an advantage over conventional supervised methods. Despite policy-based RL methods dominating the literature on RL for program synthesis, the nature of program synthesis tasks hints at a natural alignment with value-based methods. This stems from the rich collection of off-policy programs, including those developed by human programmers and also historical samples, coupled with the straightforward verification of generated programs through automated unit testing, meaning rewards are easy to obtain. Diverging from the dominant use of policy-based algorithms, our work explores the feasibility of value-based approaches, leading to the development of our $\\mathcal{B}$-Coder (pronounced Bellman coder). Yet, training value-based methods presents challenges due to the enormous search space inherent to program synthesis. To this end, we introduce an initialization protocol for RL agents utilizing pre-trained LMs and a conservative Bellman operator to reduce training complexities. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage the learned value functions as a dual strategy to post-process generated programs. Our empirical evaluations demonstrated $\\mathcal{B}$-Coder's capability in achieving state-of-the-art performance when compared to policy-based methods. Remarkably, this achievement is reached with minimal reward engineering effort, highlighting the effectiveness of value-based RL, independent of reward designs.\n",

      "Abstract: Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS) is a general solving framework for program synthesis. Previous researchers have proposed a divide-and-conquer strategy to divide the grammar search space in order to search separately. This framework converts the program synthesis problem into a decision tree classification problem. It unifies the obtained partial results into a complete program by learning decision trees according to conditional expression statements. However, due to the unknowns and uncertainties of sample label categories and sample attribute features in program synthesis, as well as the limitation of traditional decision tree learning methods to immediate gains, it results in long solving times and the large size of the candidate program. To address the above problems, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based synthesis strategy for syntax-guided programs: a) the decision tree learning process is modeled as a Markov chain decision process, addressing the learning of knowledge patterns under conceptual drift and the weighting of the importance of sample attribute features; b) a graph neural network is used to extract the feature information of the sample attributes as action embedding feature values; (c) a reward function is proposed to evaluate the classification accuracy of the sample attributes as a feedback mechanism. We have implemented our approach in a tool called RLSolver. According to the experiments, the solving times ofRLSolver are comparable to EUSolver on small-scale task datasets. RLSolver substantially reduces the solving times on large-scale task datasets, solving two more SyGus tasks than EUSolver in the same solving time limit. In addition, RLSolver reduces the number of decision tree learning rounds by 60% and the size of decision tree size by 40% after using the multi-r\u001b[0m\n",

      "Abstract: This report summarizes three areas of research investigated under the Air Force grant: (i) balancing exploration and exploitation when performing reinforcement learning in POMDPs; (ii) proper sharing of information when performing POMDP-based reinforcement learning on a network; and (Hi) topic modeling for time-evolving systems, with the latter now being transitioned to cybersecurity. For research thrust (i), a fundamental objective in reinforcement learning is the maintenance of a proper balance between exploration and exploitation. This problem becomes more challenging when the agent can only partially observe the states of its environment. In this project we propose a dual-policy method for jointly learning the agent behavior and the balance between exploration exploitation, in partially observable environments. The method subsumes traditional exploration, in which the agent takes actions to gather information about the environment, and active learning, in which the agent queries an oracle for optimal actions (with an associated cost for employing the oracle). The form of the employed exploration is dictated by the specific problem. Theoretical guarantees are provided concerning the optimality of the balancing of exploration and exploitation. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by experimental results on benchmark problems. For research thrust [ii), the Dirichlet process (DP) has proven a powerful nonparametric prior in multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL). A drawback of the DP prior is that it either encourages global clustering based on all parameters, or it encourages independent local clustering based on subsets of parameters. In this report we generalize the MTRL framework by employing the nonparametric dependent local partition process (LPP) as a prior to promote simultaneous local and global clustering. We provide theoretical analysis of the correlated local clustering structure induced by the LPP and show the structure facilitates information-sharing between partially similar RL tasks. We develop the LPP-based MTRL framework assuming the environment in each RL task is an unknown partially observable Markov decision process, and we provide experimental results to demonstrate the advantage of the LPP-based MTRL. For research thrust (ii), we consider the problem of inferring and modeling topics in a sequence of documents with known publication dates. The documents at a given time are each characterized by a topic, and the topics are drawn from a mixture model. The proposed model infers the change in the topic mixture weights as a function of time. The details of this general framework may take different forms, depending on the specifics of the model. For the examples considered here we examine base measures based on independent multinomial-Dirichlet measures for representation of topic-dependent word counts. The form of the hierarchical model allows efficient variational Bayesian (VB) inference, of interest for large-scale problems. We demonstrate results and make comparisons to the model when the dynamic character is removed, and also compare to latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and topics over time (TOT). We consider a database of NIPS papers as well as the United States presidential State of the Union addresses from 1790 to 2008. This is a demonstration of the technology, which is now being transitioned to time-evolving data from a computer network. I. EXPLORING AND EXPLOITING IN POMDPS A fundamental challenge facing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is to maintain a proper balance between exploration and exploitation. The policy designed based on previous experiences is by construction constrained, and may not be optimal as a result of inexperience. Therefore, it is desirable to take actions with the goal of enhancing experience. Although these actions may not necessarily yield optimal near-term rewa\u001b[0m\n",

      "Abstract: We propose a segmental neural language model that combines the representational power of neural networks and the structure learning mechanism of Bayesian nonparametrics, and show that it learns to discover semantically meaningful units (e.g., morphemes and words) from unsegmented character sequences. The model generates text as a sequence of segments, where each segment is generated either character-by-character from a sequence model or as a single draw from a lexical memory that stores multi-character units. Its parameters are fit to maximize the marginal likelihood of the training data, summing over all segmentations of the input, and its hyperparameters are likewise set to optimize held-out marginal likelihood. To prevent the model from overusing the lexical memory, which leads to poor generalization and bad segmentation, we introduce a differentiable regularizer that penalizes based on the expected length of each segment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of neural networks that have predictive distributions better than LSTM language models and also infer a segmentation into word-like units that are competitive with the best existing word discovery models.\n",

      "Authors: Man-Ling Sung\n",
      "Abstract: (Part of the abstract) In this thesis, we investigate the use of unsupervised spoken term discovery in tackling this problem. Unsupervised spoken term discovery aims to discover topic-related terminologies in a speech without knowing the phonetic properties of the language and content. It can be further divided into two parts: Acoustic segment modelling (ASM) and unsupervised pattern discovery. ASM learns the phonetic structures of zero-resource language audio with no phonetic knowledge available, generating self-derived \"phonemes\". The audio are labelled with these \"phonemes\" to obtain \"phoneme\" sequences. Unsupervised pattern discovery searches for repetitive patterns in the \"phoneme\" sequences. The discovered patterns can be grouped to determine the keywords of the audio. Multilingual neural network with bottleneck layer is used for feature extraction. Experiments show that bottleneck features facilitate the training of ASM compared to conventional features such as MFCC. The unsupervised spoken term discovery system is experimented with online lectures covering different topics by different speakers. It is shown that the system learns the phonetic information of the language and can discover frequent spoken terms that align with text transcription. By using information retrieval technology such as word embedding and TFIDF, it is shown that the discovered keywords can be further used for topic comparison.\n",

      "Abstract: The present study tackles the problem of automatically discovering spoken keywords from untranscribed audio archives without requiring word-by-word speech transcription by automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology. The problem is of practical significance in many applications of speech analytics, including those concerning low-resource languages, and large amount of multilingual and multi-genre data. We propose a two-stage approach, which comprises unsupervised acoustic modeling and decoding, followed by pattern mining in acoustic unit sequences. The whole process starts by deriving and modeling a set of subword-level speech units with untranscribed data. With the unsupervisedly trained acoustic models, a given audio archive is represented by a pseudo transcription, from which spoken keywords can be discovered by string mining algorithms.

      "Abstract: Abstract Evidence-based treatment is the basis of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and the accurate differentiation of syndromes is important for treatment in this context. The automatic differentiation of syndromes of unstructured medical records requires two important steps: Chinese word segmentation and text classification. Due to the ambiguity of the Chinese language and the peculiarities of syndrome differentiation, these tasks pose a daunting challenge. We use text classification to model syndrome differentiation for TCM, and use multi-task learning (MTL) and deep learning to accomplish the two challenging tasks of Chinese word segmentation and syndrome differentiation. Two classic deep neural networks—bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and text-based convolutional neural networks (TextCNN)—are fused into MTL to simultaneously carry out these two tasks. We used our proposed method to conduct a large number of comparative experiments. The experimental comparisons showed that it was superior to other methods on both tasks. Our model yielded values of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 0.93, 0.94, and 0.90, and 0.80, 0.82, and 0.78 on the Chinese word segmentation task and the syndrome differentiation task, respectively. Moreover, statistical analyses showed that the accuracies of the non-joint and joint models were both within the 95% confidence interval, with pvalue < 0.05. The experimental comparison showed that our method is superior to prevalent methods on both tasks. The work here can help modernize TCM through intelligent differentiation.\n",

It is more advantageous to extract text information in the word segmentation process. Based on the Bi-LSTM neural networks, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) neural networks can reduce the amount of calculation and cost less time. In this paper, we use Bi-LSTM to segment Chinese words and find the best hyper-parameters. BI-GRU and Bi-LSTM are employed to conduct a comparison experiment of Chinese word segmentation performance. Experimental results prove that the Bi-GRU neural networks have a faster speed, but a simpler structure than the Bi-LSTM neural networks. Meanwhile, it has no loss of word segmentation accuracy.\n",

The text data was pre-trained by BERT, BIO labeling was performed, and word vectors were obtained by encoding single Chinese characters according to double-byte encoding. Then BILSTM-CRF model was introduced to classify text labels, and the classic self-attention layer in BERT model was replaced by ProbSparse sparse self-attention layer. The performance of the model remains unchanged while the complexity of the model is reduced. The segmentation performance test is carried out on the transmission network risk text data set. The experimental results show that the segmentation accuracy, recall rate and F1 value of this model are all about 95.8%, which has a good segmentation accuracy, and the accuracy is three to five percentage points higher than that of BILSTM-CRF, CNN+LSTM, CNN+CRF and other comparison models, respe\u001b[0m\n",

These papers demonstrate the advancements and effectiveness of neural approaches, suggesting the original paper should have included a more thorough comparison. Additionally, the paper \"Is Word Segmentation Necessary for Deep Learning of Chinese Representations?\" (Li et al., 2019) questions the necessity of word segmentation for deep learning, which challenges the fundamental approach of the original paper.

      "Authors: Neng Shi, Jiayi Xu, Hanqi Guo, J. Woodring, Han-Wei Shen\n",
      "Abstract: We propose VDL-Surrogate, a view-dependent neural-network-latent-based surrogate model for parameter space exploration of ensemble simulations that allows high-resolution visualizations and user-specified visual mappings. Surrogate-enabled parameter space exploration allows domain scientists to preview simulation results without having to run a large number of computationally costly simulations. Limited by computational resources, however, existing surrogate models may not produce previews with sufficient resolution for visualization and analysis. To improve the efficient use of computational resources and support high-resolution exploration, we perform ray casting from different viewpoints to collect samples and produce compact latent representations. This latent encoding process reduces the cost of surrogate model training while maintaining the output quality. In the model training stage, we select viewpoints to cover the whole viewing sphere and train corresponding VDL-Surrogate models for the selected viewpoints. In the model inference stage, we predict the latent representations at previously selected viewpoints and decode the latent representations to data space. For any given viewpoint, we make interpolations over decoded data at selected viewpoints and generate visualizations with user-specified visual mappings. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of VDL-Surrogate in cosmological and ocean simulations with quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

      "Abstract: In this work, we present the results of a ship propeller design optimization campaign carried out in the framework of the research project PRELICA, funded by the Friuli Venezia Giulia regional government. The main idea of this work is to operate on a multidisciplinary level to identify propeller shapes that lead to reduced tip vortex-induced pressure and increased efficiency without altering the thrust. First, a specific tool for the bottom-up construction of parameterized propeller blade geometries has been developed. The algorithm proposed operates with a user defined number of arbitrary shaped or NACA airfoil sections, and employs arbitrary degree NURBS to represent the chord, pitch, skew and rake distribution as a function of the blade radial coordinate. The control points of such curves have been modified to generate, in a fully automated way, a family of blade geometries depending on as many as 20 shape parameters. Such geometries have then been used to carry out potential flow simulations with the Boundary Element Method based software PROCAL. Given the high number of parameters considered, such a preliminary stage allowed for a fast evaluation of the performance of several hundreds of shapes. In addition, the data obtained from the potential flow simulation allowed for the application of a parameter space reduction methodology based on active subspaces (AS) property, which suggested that the main propeller performance indices are, at a first but rather accurate approximation, only depending on a single parameter which is a linear combination of all the original geometric ones. AS analysis has also been used to carry out a constrained optimization exploiting response surface method in the reduced parameter space, and a sensitivity analysis based on such surrogate model. The few selected shapes were finally used to set up high fidelity RANS simulations and select an optimal shape.\n",

      "Authors: Thomas D. Cohen, Hyunwoo Oh\n",
      "Abstract: An efficient approach for preparing ground states in the context of strongly interacting local quantum field theories on quantum computers is presented. The algorithm belongs to the same class as traditional adiabatic state preparation techniques and methods based on quantum Zeno effect in that it starts with a ground state of an analytically calculable system and evolves the parameters of the Hamiltonian to the one of interest while maintaining the ground state along the path in parameter space. The approach produces the vacuum state in a time proportional to the square-root of the volume, which is a square-root improvement in speed compared to traditional approaches. The approach exploits a novel method for traversing the path in parameter space in which the resources scale linearly with a path length suitably defined in parameter space. Errors due to practical limitations are controlled and do not exhibit secular growth along the path. The final accuracy can be arbitrarily improved with an additive cost, which is independent of the volume and grows slower than logarithmically with the overlap between the state produced and the exact ground state.\n",

      "Authors: C. H. Civrais, C. White, R. Steijl\n",
      "Abstract: This work proposes an extended version of the quantum-kinetic chemistry models, aiming to accurately reproduce experimental measurements and high-fidelity calculations in both thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium. The extension involves the development of new formulations, incorporating a set of tunable parameters obtained from a non-linear least squares fit on the dataset. The newly derived analytical expressions are implemented in a direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solver. These formulations are applied to the 19 most representative chemical reactions of an air mixture involving dissociation and exchange reactions. The DSMC reaction rates demonstrate excellent agreement with the newly derived analytical expressions, providing verification of the successful implementation in the DSMC solver. The study demonstrates excellent reproduction of the baseline dataset for both thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium. Furthermore, the new formulations are applied to simulate the surface heat flux during the second space transport system (STS-II) mission at an altitude of 92.35 km.\n",

      "Abstract: The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a fundamental tool in unsupervised machine learning. It is often used as an efficient way to solve Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation problems, especially for models with latent variables. It is also the algorithm of choice to fit mixture models: generative models that represent unlabelled points originating from $k$ different processes, as samples from $k$ multivariate distributions. In this work we define and use a quantum version of EM to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model. Given quantum access to a dataset of $n$ vectors of dimension $d$, our algorithm has convergence and precision guarantees similar to the classical algorithm, but the runtime is only polylogarithmic in the number of elements in the training set, and is polynomial in other parameters - as the dimension of the feature space, and the number of components in the mixture. We generalize further the algorithm in two directions. First, we show how to fit any mixture model of probability distributions in the exponential family. Then, we show how to use this algorithm to compute the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate of a mixture model: the Bayesian approach to likelihood estimation problems. We discuss the performance of the algorithm on datasets that are expected to be classified successfully by those algorithms, arguing that on those cases we can give strong guarantees on the runtime.\n",

It is also the algorithm of choice to fit mixture models: generative models that represent unlabelled points originating from k different processes, as samples from k multivariate distributions. In this work we define and use a quantum version of EM to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model. Given quantum access to a dataset of n vectors of dimension d, our algorithm has convergence and precision guarantees similar to the classical algorithm, but the runtime is only polylogarithmic in the number of elements in the training set, and is polynomial in other parameters as the dimension of the feature space, and the number of components in the mixture. We generalize further the algorithm in two directions. First, we show how to fit any mixture model of probability distributions in the exponential family. Then, we show how to use this algorithm to compute the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate of a mixture model: the Bayesian approach to likelihood estimation problems. We discuss the performance of the algorithm on datasets that are expected to be classified successfully by those algorithms, arguing that on those cases we can give strong guarantees on the runtime.\n",

      "Abstract: It is widely believed that natural image data exhibits low-dimensional structure despite the high dimensionality of conventional pixel representations. This idea underlies a common intuition for the remarkable success of deep learning in computer vision. In this work, we apply dimension estimation tools to popular datasets and investigate the role of low-dimensional structure in deep learning. We find that common natural image datasets indeed have very low intrinsic dimension relative to the high number of pixels in the images. Additionally, we find that low dimensional datasets are easier for neural networks to learn, and models solving these tasks generalize better from training to test data. Along the way, we develop a technique for validating our dimension estimation tools on synthetic data generated by GANs allowing us to actively manipulate the intrinsic dimension by controlling the image generation process.

      "Abstract: Modern datasets are characterized by a large number of features that may conceal complex dependency structures. To deal with this type of data, dimensionality reduction techniques are essential. Numerous dimensionality reduction methods rely on the concept of intrinsic dimension, a measure of the complexity of the dataset. In this article, we first review the TWO-NN model, a likelihood-based intrinsic dimension estimator recently introduced in the literature. The TWO-NN estimator is based on the statistical properties of the ratio of the distances between a point and its first two nearest neighbors, assuming that the points are a realization from an homogeneous Poisson point process. We extend the TWO-NN theoretical framework by providing novel distributional results of consecutive and generic ratios of distances. These distributional results are then employed to derive intrinsic dimension estimators, called Cride and Gride. These novel estimators are more robust to noisy measurements than the TWO-NN and allow the study of the evolution of the intrinsic dimension as a function of the scale used to analyze the dataset. We discuss the properties of the different estimators with the help of simulation scenarios.\n",

      "Abstract: This article illustrates intRinsic, an R package that implements novel state-of-the-art likelihood-based estimators of the intrinsic dimension of a dataset, an essential quantity for most dimensionality reduction techniques. In order to make these novel estimators easily accessible, the package contains a small number of high-level functions that rely on a broader set of efficient, low-level routines. Generally speaking, intRinsic encompasses models that fall into two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The first category contains the two nearest neighbors estimator, a method derived from the distributional properties of the ratios of the distances between each data point and its first two closest neighbors. The functions dedicated to this method carry out inference under both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. In the second category, we find the heterogeneous intrinsic dimension algorithm, a Bayesian mixture model for which an efficient Gibbs sampler is implemented. After presenting the theoretical background, we demonstrate the performance of the models on simulated datasets. This way, we can facilitate the exposition by immediately assessing the validity of the results. Then, we employ the package to study the intrinsic dimension of the Alon dataset, obtained from a famous microarray experiment. Finally, we show how the estimation of homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimensions allows us to gain valuable insights into the topological structure of a dataset.\n",

      "Authors: Fulin Luo, Liangpei Zhang, Bo Du, Lefei Zhang\n",
      "Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) is an important way of improving the classification accuracy of a hyperspectral image (HSI). Graph learning, which can effectively reveal the intrinsic relationships of data, has been widely used in the case of HSIs. However, most of them are based on a simple graph to represent the binary relationships of data. An HSI contains complex high-order relationships among different samples. Therefore, in this article, we propose a hybrid-graph learning method to reveal the complex high-order relationships of the HSI, termed enhanced hybrid-graph discriminant learning (EHGDL). In EHGDL, an intraclass hypergraph and an interclass hypergraph are constructed to analyze the complex multiple relationships of a HSI. Then, a supervised locality graph is applied to reveal the binary relationships of a HSI which can form the complementarity of a hypergraph. Simultaneously, we also construct a weighted neighborhood margin model to boost the difference of samples from different classes. Finally, we design a DR model based on the intraclass hypergraph, the interclass hypergraph, the supervised locality graph, and the weighted neighborhood margin to improve the compactness of the intraclass samples and the separability of the interclass samples, and an optimal projection matrix can be achieved to extract the low-dimensional embedding features of the HSI. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments have been conducted on the Indian Pines, PaviaU, and HoustonU data sets. The experimental results show that EHGDL can generate better classification performance compared with some related DR methods. As a result, EHGDL can better reveal the complex intrinsic relationships of a HSI by the complementarity of different characteristics and enhance the discriminant performance of land-cover types.\n",

      "Authors: Zhi Xu, Zelin Jiang, Longyang Zhao, Shu Li, Qi Liu\n",
      "Abstract: Abstract. Dimensionality reduction techniques can remove redundant information from hyperspectral images (HSIs) and improve discriminability. However, due to the inherent nonlinear characteristics of HSI, there may be non-Euclidean structures in the data and its topological properties may make it suboptimal to recover the low-dimensional manifolds by means of a linear projection. As a result, linear projection from high-dimensional space to low-dimensional discriminative space is not always effective. To better explore the intrinsic geometric structure of HSI, we propose a Gaussian manifold metric learning (GMML) method, which performs explicit and nonlinear dimensionality reduction for HSI. It models pixel neighborhoods as Gaussian distributions to combine spatial and spectral information. In GMML, samples are mapped as elements on the Gaussian manifold consisting of Gaussian distributions to retain the intrinsic characteristics of data. By treating the inner product of the tangent space on the manifold as a kernel function, our method performs metric learning in the tangent space. Therefore, the proposed GMML method makes intra-class samples more compact and inter-class samples more separated while preserving the geometric structure information inherent in the data. Experiments on six real hyperspectral datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed GMML algorithm to extract discriminating features compared to several related methods.\n",

The proposed GAN generates high-quality images for minority classes, improving data diversity and classification performance. By integrating Global Context Attention (GCA) and UpBlock-CompRes modules, the GAN generates images that closely resemble real data, achieving superior results in FID, IS, PSNR, and SSIM compared to FastGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GAN outperforms both the baseline without data augmentation and FastGAN, with noticeable improvements across key metrics.

      "Abstract: Ultrasound images are used in various branches of medicine to detect diseases. The process of obtaining this data is complex due to procedures and legal restrictions, leading to scarce datasets. Different data augmentation techniques can be employed to improve classification performance. This paper shows that augmenting the ultrasound breast cancer images dataset using generative adversarial networks (GANs) increased the classification accuracy compared to the original dataset and compared to the dataset augmented using standard techniques.\n",

      "Authors: Hongwei Ding, Kuan Zhang, Nana Huang\n",
      "Abstract: In medical data processing, the issue of data imbalance often leads to biased learning outcomes in machine learning methods. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) can generate realistic and diverse augmented samples to balance sample distribution. However, the problems of intra-class imbalance and sparse isolated samples often affect the performance of GAN models. Based on this, this paper proposes a multi-generator GAN model architecture, named Diversity Multi-Generator GAN (DM-GAN). This model combines self-attention mechanisms and diversity loss functions to improve the quality and diversity of generated samples. Specifically, we designed multiple independently trained generators to capture more sample patterns and introduced self-attention modules in both the generator and discriminator to enhance the model’s ability to capture image details. Additionally, we proposed an improved generator loss function that combines mode-seeking loss and mutual exclusion loss. By encouraging the generation of different samples and reducing sample overlap, this approach enhances the diversity and coverage of generated samples. Experimental results on two real-world medical image datasets demonstrate that DM-GAN shows significant advantages in handling intra-class imbalance and isolated sample issues. Compared to existing methods, our approach not only achieves better results in terms of the quality and diversity of generated samples but also effectively improves the performance of downstream classification tasks.\n",

      "Authors: Emil Kriukov, Jonathan R. Soucy, Everett Labrecque, Petr Baranov\n",
      "Abstract: Tissue development is a complex spatiotemporal process with multiple interdependent components. Anatomical, histological, sequencing, and evolutional strategies can be used to profile and explain tissue development from different perspectives. The introduction of scRNAseq methods and the computational tools allows to deconvolute developmental heterogeneity and draw a decomposed uniform map. In this manuscript, we decomposed the development of a human retina with a focus on the retinal ganglion cells (RGC). To increase the temporal resolution of retinal cell classes maturation state we assumed the working hypothesis that that maturation of retinal ganglion cells is a continuous, non-discrete process. We have assembled the scRNAseq atlas of human fetal retina from fetal week 8 to week 27 and applied the computational methods to unravel maturation heterogeneity into a uniform maturation track. We align RGC transcriptomes in pseudotime to map RGC developmental fate trajectories against the broader timeline of retinal development. Through this analysis, we identified the continuous maturation track of RGC and described the cell-intrinsic (DEGs, maturation gene profiles, regulons, transcriptional motifs) and -extrinsic profiles (neurotrophic receptors across maturation, cell-cell interactions) of different RGC maturation states. We described the genes involved in the retina and RGC maturation, including de novo RGC maturation drivers. We demonstrate the application of the human fetal retina atlas as a reference tool, allowing automated annotation and universal embedding of scRNAseq data. Altogether, our findings deepen the current knowledge of the retina and RGC maturation by bringing in the maturation dimension for the cell class vs. state analysis. We show how the pseudotime application contributes to developmental-oriented analyses, allowing to order the cells by their maturation state. This approach not only improves the downstream computational analysis but also provides a true maturation track transcriptomics profile.\n",

      "Abstract: As technology advanced, collecting data via automatic collection devices become popular, thus we commonly face data sets with lengthy variables, especially when these data sets are collected without specific research goals beforehand. It has been pointed out in the literature that the difficulty of high-dimensional classification problems is intrinsically caused by too many noise variables useless for reducing classification error, which offer less benefits for decision-making, and increase complexity, and confusion in model-interpretation. A good variable selection strategy is therefore a must for using such kinds of data well; especially when we expect to use their results for the succeeding applications/studies, where the model-interpretation ability is essential. hus, the conventional classification measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, cannot be the only performance tasks. In this paper, we propose a probability-based nonparametric multiple-class classification method, and integrate it with the ability of identifying high impact variables for individual class such that we can have more information about its classification rule and the character of each class as well. The proposed method can have its prediction power approximately equal to that of the Bayes rule, and still retains the ability of\"model-interpretation.\"We report the asymptotic properties of the proposed method, and use both synthesized and real data sets to illustrate its properties un\u001b[0m\n",

      "applications, there is a limited understanding of how model characteristics\n",

      "its impact on convergence of SGD with random reshuffle under weak strong\n",
      "convexity. Specifically, minimizer incoherence measures the discrepancy between\n",
      "the global minimizers of a sample loss and those of the total loss and affects\n",
      "the convergence error of SGD with random reshuffle. In particular, we show that\n",
      "the variable sequence generated by SGD with random reshuffle converges to a\n",
      "certain global minimizer of the total loss under full minimizer coherence. The\n",
      "other curvature incoherence measures the quality of condition numbers of the\n",
      "sample losses and determines the convergence rate of SGD. With model\n",
      "incoherence, our results show that SGD has a faster convergence rate and\n",

      "Summary: Nesterov SGD is widely used for training modern neural networks and other\n",
      "machine learning models. Yet, its advantages over SGD have not been\n",
      "theoretically clarified. Indeed, as we show in our paper, both theoretically\n",
      "and empirically, Nesterov SGD with any parameter selection does not in general\n",
      "provide acceleration over ordinary SGD. Furthermore, Nesterov SGD may diverge\n",
      "for step sizes that ensure convergence of ordinary SGD. This is in contrast to\n",
      "the classical results in the deterministic scenario, where the same step size\n",
      "ensures accelerated convergence of the Nesterov's method over optimal gradient\n",

      "Abstract: To unveil how the brain learns, ongoing work seeks biologically-plausible approximations of gradient descent algorithms for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Yet, beyond task accuracy, it is unclear if such learning rules converge to solutions that exhibit different levels of generalization than their nonbiologically-plausible counterparts. Leveraging results from deep learning theory based on loss landscape curvature, we ask: how do biologically-plausible gradient approximations affect generalization? We first demonstrate that state-of-the-art biologically-plausible learning rules for training RNNs exhibit worse and more variable generalization performance compared to their machine learning counterparts that follow the true gradient more closely. Next, we verify that such generalization performance is correlated significantly with loss landscape curvature, and we show that biologically-plausible learning rules tend to approach high-curvature regions in synaptic weight space. Using tools from dynamical systems, we derive theoretical arguments and present a theorem explaining this phenomenon. This predicts our numerical results, and explains why biologically-plausible rules lead to worse and more variable generalization properties. Finally, we suggest potential remedies that could be used by the brain to mitigate this effect.
